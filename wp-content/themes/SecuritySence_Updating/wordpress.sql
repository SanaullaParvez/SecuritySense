The <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/changelog/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/changelog/">changelog</a> for Jetpack is usually a mile long but in this case, I was happy to see that the Widget Visibility module was added to Jetpack. Widget Visibility was made available to WordPress.com <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/widget-visibility-when-do-we-get-that" title="http://www.wptavern.com/widget-visibility-when-do-we-get-that">earlier this year</a>. <span id="more-8754"></span></p>\n<div id="attachment_7009" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WidgetVisibility.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WidgetVisibility.jpg?resize=399%2C189" alt="Widget Visibility" class="size-full wp-image-7009" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Now Available In Jetpack</p></div>\n<p>As I mentioned in my initial post discussing the feature, the interface is surprisingly simple to use. In 2011, <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/feedback-needed-for-new-widget-context-user-interface" title="http://www.wptavern.com/feedback-needed-for-new-widget-context-user-interface">I shared my thoughts</a> on what I think would work for a widget control interface.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nIâm thinking of a plugin thatâs a cross between Widget Logic and Widget Context. This plugin should work on the premise that anytime a widget is added to a sidebar, itâs viewable across the entire site where that sidebar loads. UI is added to the widget screen so that I can easily search or choose from the various template files that make up my theme to decide where the widget will be displayed. By specifically configuring where the widget will be displayed, Iâve also configured where it will not be displayed. Iâm not quite sure which user interface would work best for selecting more than one area where the widgets will be displayed, perhaps the check box method that already exists in Widget Context. This is about all Iâd need to satisfy my needs. Itâs simple, not many options and I think covers the basis for a lot of uses. Now, if Kaspars or users suggested that they wanted rules, or more complex ways of telling their widgets where to show up or hide, I would not complain about having an Advanced tab that showed additional options. But I definitely donât want that clutter in view as part of the default configuration UI.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What I requested in 2011 is not far from what Widget Visibility offers. Instead of choosing template files within a theme, I can choose between <strong>category, author, tag, date, page</strong> which are theme agnostic and cover the gamut of options I&#8217;d need to hide or show a widget. I&#8217;m glad they didn&#8217;t listen to me when I described the interface. I only wish something this simple would have been added to WordPress a long time ago. What something like Widget Visibility offers is an easy way to make one sidebar serve multiple purposes without needing to create separate sidebars with specific widgets. This opens up a lot more versatility for displaying widgets. While I&#8217;m still excited to see this piece of functionality accessible to a large audience through Jetpack, I can&#8217;t help but think about how much more exciting it would have been to see this as an added feature back in the WordPress 3.0 days. </p>\n<p>Now I can retire the Widget Logic plugin which required me to know WordPress conditional tags in order to control when and where widgets displayed.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/YEL7zT0yzf0" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 17:47:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"WordPress.tv: Frederick Townes: Business Optimization";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=21611";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/30/frederick-townes-business-optimization/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:674:"<div id="v-EICJD1L0-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/21611/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/21611/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=21611&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/30/frederick-townes-business-optimization/"><img alt="Frederick Townes: Business Optimizationation" src="http://videos.videopress.com/EICJD1L0/keynote-business-optimization_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 11:07:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WordPress.tv: Mel Choyce: Whatâs Your Problem, Man?

That is, perform automatic updates without breaking anything to the point where you don&#8217;t even know the software has updated. On the Make WordPress Core blog, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/08/28/core-updates-in-3-7/" title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/08/28/core-updates-in-3-7/">we find out</a> how this will possibly become a reality with WordPress 3.7. A plugin created by Pento called <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/automatic-updater/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/automatic-updater/">Automatic Updater</a> will be used as the framework to provide this functionality. The first step is for the automation of minor releases. For example 3.7 to 3.7.1 would happen automatically. Andrew Nacin outlines a number of tickets that need to be addressed surrounding this functionality. <span id="more-8748"></span></p>\n<p>One of the first comments on that blog post is from Joshua Strebel, CEO of <a href="http://page.ly" title="http://page.ly">Page.ly</a> which is a large managed WordPress hosting service.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Please consider an opt-out constant/mechanism simply for those of us that run multi-tenancy and manage the entire core package from the top down.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Andrew followed up by noting there will be a mechanism to opt out which will not be accessible from the user interface. Instead, it will most likely be a filter or a constant to not only opt-out of upgrades, but also to enable upgrading to major releases as well in case you wanted full-blown automation. However, they are looking for more feedback from hosting companies and are encouraging them to follow the development of this feature. </p>\n<p>Back around September of 2011, I asked whether <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/should-automatic-upgrades-be-opt-in" title="http://www.wptavern.com/should-automatic-upgrades-be-opt-in">Automatic upgrades for WordPress should be opt-in</a>? Out of 210 votes, 67% or 141 said yes while 69 voted no. At the time, I felt like WordPress wanted to hold my hand too much when it came to managing my install. However, I am completely fine with automatic upgrades to minor releases leaving me to upgrade to major versions when I feel comfortable doing so. The <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/should-automatic-upgrades-be-opt-in#comments" title="http://www.wptavern.com/should-automatic-upgrades-be-opt-in#comments">conversation in the comments</a> following the poll are worth a read, even if the conversation was two years ago. It would be interesting to hear from those who participated in that conversation to see if their views have changed, especially since we now know that the default upgrade functionality will be for minor releases. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Iâm just thinking you might want to consider more than the most obvious point of view about upgrades. When was the last time you upgraded Chrome? Did you know it upgraded itself, about twice a week? Did you notice? Did you care? Thatâs the kind of thing I think we should shoot for. You shouldnât notice upgrades, they should just happen. And not fail, of course. &#8211; <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/should-automatic-upgrades-be-opt-in#comment-12763" title="http://www.wptavern.com/should-automatic-upgrades-be-opt-in#comment-12763">Otto</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Hmm, Otto mentioned the way Chrome upgrades in 2011, Matt talks about it as the model for WordPress in 2013 and that&#8217;s the way we&#8217;re headed. Perhaps Otto has a future telling crystal skull?</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/oqbc1vm7NYc" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 05:58:42 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"WPTavern: WordPress Weekly iTunes Subscription Information";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8741";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:110:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/WUn7j6tszac/wordpress-weekly-itunes-subscription-information";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2024:"<p>Since the creation of WordPress Weekly back in 2008, I&#8217;ve used <a href="http://www.talkshoe.com/tc/34224" title="http://www.talkshoe.com/tc/34224">Talkshoe.com</a> to record the show in front of a live audience.

The plugin is licensed under the GPL and has three different pricing tiers. Single site for $55.00, 2-5 sites for $75.00 and 6-25 sites for $95.00. </p>\n<h2>Description And Review:</h2>\n<p>Leaky Paywall takes a different approach to enticing users to pay for content. Normally, paywalls are hard stops that prevent content from being consumed, or shared for that matter unless you pay up. Some of these paywalls are configured in such a way that not only can humans not consume the content, but neither can search engines. Using leaky paywall, site administrators get to decide which combination of content types can be leaked out. The choices range from <em>pages, posts, articles, and Issues</em>, if you have the <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/creating-a-digital-publication-in-wordpress-with-the-issuem-plugin" title="http://www.wptavern.com/creating-a-digital-publication-in-wordpress-with-the-issuem-plugin">IssueM plugin</a> installed. The biggest difference between this paywall system and others is that content behind the paywall can be crawled by search engines and can also be shared via social media. As long as the number of free posts is 1 or higher, articles being shared across social media will not show the paywall message for new visitors. <span id="more-8496"></span></p>\n<p>Leaky Paywall is cookie based which enables it to work as intended. However, it also means that it&#8217;s as simple as deleting cookies to get around the paywall. When I asked Peter what would site administrators do to protect against people getting behind the paywall by either turning cookies off or deleting them once they&#8217;ve hit the free article limit, this was his response:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nothing, that&#8217;s the leaky part. It works for the NYTimes because 95% of humans are honest or don&#8217;t want to be bothered with having to &#8220;get around&#8221; the system.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You get to choose how many articles can be viewed for free as well as when the free article cookie expires. </p>\n<div id="attachment_8498" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/LeakyPaywallOptions.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/LeakyPaywallOptions.jpg?resize=500%2C379" alt="Leaky Pay Wall Options" class="size-large wp-image-8498" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Leaky Pay Wall Options</p></div>\n<p>You can configure the subscribe or login message which is the message that will be viewed to those who have reached their free article limit. The message can either use the default CSS style that comes with the plugin or none at all. By default, it will look like this:</p>\n<div id="attachment_8499" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/LeakyPaywallSubscribeCSS.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/LeakyPaywallSubscribeCSS.jpg?resize=500%2C128" alt="Subscribe Box CSS" class="size-large wp-image-8499" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Default CSS</p></div>\n<p>Out of the box, Leaky Paywall only supports the Stripe Payment gateway for recurring payments but there will be more payment processors in the future. </p>\n<h2>Support:</h2>\n<p>There are a couple of different ways of obtaining support. The first is access to <a href="http://issuem.com/forums/" title="http://issuem.com/forums/">basic support forums</a> where registration is free. The second is by purchasing a 1 Month support package for $39 that provides access to the priority support section of the forum with the promise of getting you a response within 8 business hours. The third is a yearly priority support package for $129 that gives you all of the above for a year. There is also <a href="http://issuem.com/category/training/" title="http://issuem.com/category/training/">free access to training material</a> on their training page. </p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts:</h2>\n<p>While I was originally against the idea of Paywalls, something like what Leaky Paywall provides has changed my mind. It&#8217;s not intrusive, the built-in Stripe Payment gateway makes it easy to pay/subscribe to the site without the need for a password and content can still be shared as well as consumed by the outside world without any problems.</p>\n<div class="aligncenter"></div>\n<h2>Coupon Code</h2>\n<p>Readers of WPTavern.com who are interested in purchasing the plugin can use the coupon code <strong>LeakyTavern2013</strong> to receive 50% off the price. There are only 10 available so it&#8217;s first come, first serve. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/DcgKaMjn1fA" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 29 Aug 2013 11:00:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"WordPress.tv: Brad Parbs: Getting SASSy â Fun with CSS Preprocessors";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=21700";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/29/brad-parbs-getting-sassy-fun-with-css-preprocessors/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:687:"<div id="v-rGnRsjzP-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/21700/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/21700/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=21700&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/29/brad-parbs-getting-sassy-fun-with-css-preprocessors/"><img alt="Brad Parbs: Getting SASSy â Fun with CSS Preprocessors" src="http://videos.videopress.com/rGnRsjzP/getting-sassy-fun_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 29 Aug 2013 11:00:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:52:"WPTavern: WP Site Care On WordPress Weekly This Week";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8730";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/fLKmSbegUj8/wp-site-care-on-wordpress-weekly-this-week";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1476:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wpsitecarelogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wpsitecarelogo.jpg?resize=300%2C42" alt="WP Site Care Logo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8732" /></a>Ryan Sullivan and Rami Abraham of <a href="http://www.wpsitecare.com/" title="http://www.wpsitecare.com/">WPSitecare</a> will be my special guests this week on WordPress Weekly.

the week-end, I received an email from Mollom notifying me that they had discovered a security breach. According to their <a href="http://mollom.com/blog/security-notice-august-2013" title="http://mollom.com/blog/security-notice-august-2013">official blog post</a> on the matter, the breach was discovered on August 21st. Mollom is a service managed by Acquia, a commercial open source software company providing products, services, and technical support for the open source Drupal social publishing system. The service works in a similar fashion to Akismet in that it scans messages such as comments to determine whether or not they are spam. <span id="more-8706"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>This is an important security notice from the Mollom team. On August 21, we identified a breach of one of our Mollom servers. Our subsequent investigation showed that unauthorized users gained access to Mollom servers and were potentially able to access Mollom data. Today we have closed the security loophole used to gain access and taken measures designed to prevent future breaches.</p>\n<p>Data that may have been compromised includes usernames, account contact information, passwords, Mollom public and private keys, and billing transaction logs. PayPal account information was NOT stored on the affected servers.</p>\n<p>At this time, we have no evidence that any malicious activity took place with customer data. To help assure this continues to be the case, in addition to the measures described above, we have changed all Mollom user account passwords. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Mollom has automatically reset all user account passwords to access the administrative interface. This means you&#8217;ll need to access the <a href="http://mollom.com/user/password" title="http://mollom.com/user/password">following URL</a> in order to reset your password. </p>\n<p>The bottom line is if you signed up to use Mollom free or as a paid customer, you should reset your password and keep a close eye on your financial records, especially if you have or had a paid account even though credit card information was not stored on the affected server. The unauthorized access was <strong>NOT</strong> a direct result of a vulnerability within Drupal. If any additional information is discovered during their investigation, the Mollom team will continue to update the blog post.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/SeNQaf5t6Yo" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 18:45:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"Matt: Harder, Slower, Less Secure";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=42965";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"http://ma.tt/2013/08/harder-slower-less-secure/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:352:"<p>Jay Rosen (and Barry Eisler) on the surveillance state&#8217;s efforts <a href="http://pressthink.org/2013/08/to-make-journalism-harder-slower-less-secure/">to make journalism harder, slower, less secure</a>.

The site doesn&#8217;t have a huge variety of images to choose from now but over the course of the next few months, I think that will change. I reached out to Alison Barrett who manages the site to find out about its history and what plans if any she has for the site. <span id="more-8568"></span></p>\n<div id="attachment_8569" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WordPressLights.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WordPressLights.jpg?resize=439%2C275" alt="WordPress Lights by Alison Barrett " class="size-full wp-image-8569" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordPress Lights by Alison Barrett</p></div>\n<p><strong>Can you provide a brief history of the domain, considering it existed before you purchased it?</strong></p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know much about the previous owner of the domain. The original site was my main source of desktop wallpapers for a long time, and I had referred dozens of people to it. I was bummed when I learned the site was down. I went searching for the owner, and I didn&#8217;t realize the domain had expired until the whois search turned up empty.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you know of any other sites that have an abundant amount of WordPress desktop wallpapers?</strong></p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t think of any other dedicated WP wallpaper sites off the top of my head, though a Google search might turn up one or two. I didn&#8217;t come across any when I was searching for the creators of the wallpapers on the original site.</p>\n<p>My initial reason for buying the domain was that I felt bad for referring friends to something that wasn&#8217;t even live anymore. Now I&#8217;m enjoying running the site, and I love seeing all the excitement around it. The community&#8217;s response to it is driving me to keep making it even better. I would love to find the creators of the wallpapers from the original site, because there were a lot of gorgeous images up there. I don&#8217;t want to republish them without attribution and permission.</p>\n<p><strong>Any chance of getting this site linked to from the Fan Art section of WordPress.org or having a small dedicated section showing 3-6 wallpapers?</strong></p>\n<p>I hadn&#8217;t thought about getting this site linked under the Fan Art section on .orgâthat&#8217;s a great idea! I&#8217;ll see what I can do.</p>\n<p><strong>Any chance of adding a ratings system, reviews, or any other social aspects to the images similar to DeviantArt?</strong></p>\n<p>I do plan on implementing a ratings system eventually, though my priority right now is supporting multiple resolutions for each wallpaper (including mobile). I will probably add some sharing tools in the near future as well.</p>\n<p><strong>How can people submit images to the site and how should the submissions be licensed? </strong></p>\n<p>Wallpapers can be submitted through the form on the submit page: <a href="http://wp-wallpaper.com/submit/" title="http://wp-wallpaper.com/submit/">http://wp-wallpaper.com/submit/</a> . Technical requirements are laid out there (and will be updated once I get mobile resolution support in place). Images must be released under the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license, as that is what they are distributed under on the site.</p>\n<h2>Oops: After The Launch</h2>\n<p>After this interview was conducted with Alison, I did some research into the history of the domain since she didn&#8217;t know too much about it. I plugged the domain into the Wayback machine and didn&#8217;t see any results. For a site that Alison pointed to over the years for WordPress wallpapers, it stands to reason it would have some history behind it. Just for experimentation, I added an S to the end of the domain so it was <a href="http://wp-wallpapers.com/" title="http://wp-wallpapers.com/">http://wp-wallpapers.com/</a> and while that particular domain has expired, it did show up with quite a few results in the Wayback machine.</p>\n<p>The first record on the internet archive is for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111017210657/http://wp-wallpapers.com/" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20111017210657/http://wp-wallpapers.com/">October 17th 2011</a>. This entry tells us that WP-Wallpapers.com used the Expose theme from ThemeForest to show off the content of the site. That theme is still available for sale but is not 100% GPL licensed. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPWallPapers.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPWallPapers.jpg?resize=500%2C359" alt="WP Wallpapers" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8699" /></a></p>\n<p>The next entry was a WordPress maintenance page. However, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120331034901/http://wp-wallpapers.com/" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20120331034901/http://wp-wallpapers.com/?">On March 31st 2012</a>, the site had a few pages of Wallpapers available. It&#8217;s also during this time that we discover the site was owned and operated by the Envato network. The last working entry is on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130323233732/http://wp-wallpapers.com/" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20130323233732/http://wp-wallpapers.com/">March 23rd, 2013</a> with at least 5 pages worth of wallpaper images. </p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>So not only has Alison pointed people to the wrong domain over the years, she also purchased the wrong domain. She missed it by one letter. I reached out to Envato to find out what their plans are for the domain:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re always trying to streamline our processes and focus more on the projects that really matter to us, which is why we decided to discontinue WP-Wallpapers.com. But we&#8217;re really happy to see WP-Wallpaper spring up to fill the gap! There are definitely some beautiful, creative WordPress wallpapers around.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite everything that&#8217;s happened up to this point with WP-Wallpaper.com, Alison is still excited to see the site grow. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/3luWcT9hGW8" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 04:45:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"WPTavern: My Experience â WordCamp Grand Rapids 2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8635";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/Tu_vAh6bwrA/my-experience-wordcamp-grand-rapids-2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15414:"<h2>Things I Learned About The City</h2>\n<p>This event marks the first time I&#8217;ve visited Grand Rapids, Michigan. I can say without any doubt that Grand Rapids is a beautiful city. I got the impression while being downtown that I was in a large city but it wasn&#8217;t large enough to feel inundated like New York or San Francisco. The skyline has large buildings but you can still see the horizon in some parts of downtown. The city also has a wide river that flows through and around the city which from what I&#8217;ve read, is the origin of the city&#8217;s name. However, I saw the river as wide, shallow, and nothing rapid about it. There is talk in the local community around the idea of placing large boulders back into the river to generate rapids but I&#8217;m unsure of that progress. <span id="more-8635"></span></p>\n<p>The other thing I learned while in Grand Rapids was the number of local breweries in the region. I had the pleasure of eating at two of these breweries. One was called <a href="http://foundersbrewing.com/" title="http://foundersbrewing.com/">Founders</a>, the other was <a href="http://www.grbrewingcompany.com/" title="http://www.grbrewingcompany.com/">Grand Rapids Brewing Company</a>. The food was excellent in both locations and although I didn&#8217;t drink any beer since I&#8217;m not a hoppy kind of guy, the WordCamp attendees I was surrounded by couldn&#8217;t stop raving about some of the beers they tasted at each place. The third place I ate at in which I did try a beer (Brouwerij Lindeman Vlezenbeek, Belgium a raspberry flavored beer) was <a href="http://hopcatgr.com/main/About.aspx" title="http://hopcatgr.com/main/About.aspx">HopCat</a>. A place with something called &#8216;<strong>Crack Fries</strong>&#8216;. These crack fries are considered famous in the area because of the unique blend of spices applied to them. After eating them, you&#8217;ll understand why they have their name.</p>\n<h2>The Event Itself</h2>\n<p>The event was held at the <a href="http://www.gvsu.edu/" title="http://www.gvsu.edu/">DeVos Center on Grand Valley State Universityâs Pew Campus</a> in downtown Grand Rapids. Out of all the WordCamps I&#8217;ve attended, those that are at some sort of college campus location have gone smoothly. This one was no exception. Although I didn&#8217;t attend very many sessions, I did manage to catch up with quite a few people to talk shop and other interesting things going on in the world of WordPress. At this particular WordCamp, I moderated a panel discussion on the topic of Commercial Themes and Plugins with Pippin Williamson, Adam Pickering, Daniel Espinoza, and Jake Caputo. I think the session went over rather well and we covered a lot of information. The one thing that kept coming up multiple times during the talk was support. It&#8217;s expensive but it&#8217;s also the most valuable and potentially the most vital aspect of any business. We also discussed various methods to handle support as forums are great at the early stage but something like ZenDesk and tickets make sense for larger volumes of support requests. I definitely took some feedback to heart concerning my delivery and approach on stage during the session and if I ever moderate a panel like this again, the second one will be 10 times better than the first. Thanks to Brian Richards, one of the event organizers for giving me the opportunity to moderate the panel.</p>\n<p>The session that opened my eyes was <a href="http://2013.grandrapids.wordcamp.org/session/scoping-projects-a-therapy-session-for-those-who-do-client-work/" title="http://2013.grandrapids.wordcamp.org/session/scoping-projects-a-therapy-session-for-those-who-do-client-work/">Scoping Projects</a> â A Therapy Session For Those Who Do Client Work Lisa Sabin-Wilson. Not so much from the perspective of the consultant but from the perspective of a client, realizing everything the consultant has to go through to get the job done. Her idea of scoping and how important it is to get everything on the table before starting work was key. She also discussed why having assumptions can costs you big bucks, wasted time, and make you look bad in front of the client. There should be 0 assumptions from both parties in a project. As a future client myself, I realized that I could make the process go a lot easier for both parties if I scoped out everything I wanted, every nuance, provided documentation, references for ideas and inspiration, etc. The more information I can provide the consultant about my needs, the better off we&#8217;ll both be. It was a session that I didn&#8217;t think would appeal to me but it was the most eye-opening one I&#8217;ve attended in a long time. It was an interesting experience being in a room full of people and seeing/hearing their reaction when Lisa mentioned that <a href="http://lisasabin-wilson.com/tighten-up-those-terms-and-keep-copies-of-everything-forever/" title="http://lisasabin-wilson.com/tighten-up-those-terms-and-keep-copies-of-everything-forever/">she had been investigated by the FBI</a> and to perform a Google search to read about it. I won&#8217;t spoil it for you, you&#8217;ll just have to read her post. </p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Most of the time during the week-end I was involved in multiple conversations with all sorts of people doing awesome things with WordPress. Overall, it was a fantastic event. The organizers as well as the volunteers should be proud of themselves. I had such a good experience within Grand Rapids that I&#8217;m thinking of taking my wife there to experience more of the city. While contributor day was awesome at WordCamp San Francisco, it was nowhere near as effective at WordCamp Grand Rapids. I think a lot of that has to do with the right people not being in attendance such as core contributors, project managers, etc. With that said, those who did show up to contributor day were working with other people on WordPress or were taking the knowledge and ideas they gained the past two days to improve their own sites or projects. This has me wondering if any other WordCamp will be able to have a contributor day as beneficial as the one held at WordCamp San Francisco 2013? </p>\n\n<a

has been a new post published on the WordPress Events site that <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/events/2013/08/20/organizing-a-non-wordcamp/" title="http://make.wordpress.org/events/2013/08/20/organizing-a-non-wordcamp/">outlines a set of proposed guidelines</a> for non-WordCamp events that are created by previous WordCamp organizers. With at least two previous WordCamp organizers putting on their own events this year outside of the WordCamp name, these guidelines are necessary to make sure both events can coexist peacefully without causing confusion to WordCamp attendees. </p>\n<p>First of all, I commend Andrea Middleton and the WordPress.org Events team for putting the proposal out into the open for discussion. Not too long ago, changes like the ones presented in the proposal would have just happened with no discussion and we&#8217;ve seen in the past that this is a recipe for disaster which ends up causing a rift in the community. So far, the discussion surrounding the guidelines has been calm and level-headed. Even Matt Mullenweg has participated in the conversation. </p>\n<p>The proposed guidelines come across as a bunch of common sense to me. I especially like the fact that videos from non WordCamp events are encouraged to be shared on WordPress.tv as long as they meet the <a href="http://blog.wordpress.tv/submission-guidelines/" title="http://blog.wordpress.tv/submission-guidelines/">submission guidelines</a>. If you are a current, past, or future WordCamp organizer, be sure to give the guidelines a read and weigh in. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/hTBOFW6LoLo" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 20:22:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"WordPress.tv: Christina Elmore: From URL To ISBN: Making Books From Blogs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=21534";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/23/christina-elmore-from-url-to-isbn-making-books-from-blogs/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:745:"<div id="v-b3mX5BqG-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/21534/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/21534/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=21534&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/23/christina-elmore-from-url-to-isbn-making-books-from-blogs/"><img alt="Christina Elmore: From URL To ISBN: Making Books From Blogs" src="http://videos.videopress.com/b3mX5BqG/01-christina-elmore-from-url-to-isbn-making-books-from-blogs_scruberthumbnail_0.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 19:43:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"WPTavern: Details Behind The WordPress Jobs Board Redesign";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8606";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:110:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/bfFRfLUm4VM/details-behind-the-wordpress-jobs-board-redesign";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7472:"<p>The official <a href="http://jobs.wordpress.net/" title="http://jobs.wordpress.net/">WordPress Job board</a> was <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/meta/2013/07/17/seeking-2-moderators-for-jobs-wordpress-net/" title="http://make.wordpress.org/meta/2013/07/17/seeking-2-moderators-for-jobs-wordpress-net/">recently relaunched</a> with a brand new design. Considering the <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/07/27/wordpress-jobs/" title="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/07/27/wordpress-jobs/">site has existed since 2007</a> and has not seen very much in the way of upgrades since then, I thought it would be interesting to hear from Scott Reilly and Mel Choyce if there were any difficulties upgrading the site. Mel was involved in the discussions and design portions of the project while Scott did much of the implementation. <span id="more-8606"></span></p>\n<p><strong>What were some of the challenges upgrading from the previous design?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Mel Choyce</strong> &#8211; I think one of the biggest challenges we faced was trying to bring the site up to standards with the evolving WordPress.org branding. The old site just didn&#8217;t feel like it was officially sanctioned, which I think caused some trust issues. When I looked at it, I didn&#8217;t really see WordPress. I really approached the design with the concept of, how can we make this feel more like WordPress? How can we make this look more official?</p>\n<p>Another part we struggled with was updating the categories. The old categories were a little vague and generic, so we tried to tighten those up to make it easier for job posters to appropriately categorize their jobs. </p>\n<div id="attachment_8607" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPJobsBoardVersion1.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPJobsBoardVersion1.jpg?resize=500%2C236" alt="WordPress Jobs Board Old Design" class="size-large wp-image-8607" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Old Jobs Board Design</p></div>\n<div id="attachment_8608" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPJobsBoardVersion2.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPJobsBoardVersion2.jpg?resize=500%2C287" alt="WordPress Jobs Board New Design" class="size-large wp-image-8608" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">New Jobs Board Design</p></div>\n<p><strong>Scott Reilly</strong> &#8211; From the technical side of things, for the most part we reimplemented the entire site, keeping mostly just the data. Even then, we migrated and massaged some of the data in the process. But all in all, the technical implementation was fairly straightforward. The biggest challenges were mostly in coming up with a design (Mel) and then forming a team around the project. Heretofore, Mark Ghosh had been pretty much running the site singlehandedly, which was a monumental effort. This included the custom code to run the site as well as the daily moderation of job postings. So we put out the call for volunteer moderators and began to formalize the guidelines.</p>\n<p><strong>One of the biggest differences between the two designs is the addition of a sidebar of icons that symbolize different position types. By the way, those icons look familiar. Was this approach considered the best way to easily dig into all of the jobs openings available or is this just one method you&#8217;re trying?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Mel Choyce</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m not totally sure what you&#8217;re asking? We chose a vertical navigation bar to make it easier to scan for categories. The previous design had a horizontal navigation bar, and there were so many categories that it was just kind of hard to quickly look through it. </p>\n<p>We ended up borrowing heavily from the MP6 aesthetic, so the inclusion of icons not only helped reinforce the brand, but also subtly reinforced the meaning of each category. I had made some icons, but they lacked finesse and polish, so I asked Ben Dunkle (lead icon designer for WordPress.org) to play around with some different ideas for each category. I think they ended up pretty slick.</p>\n<div id="attachment_8610" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DashIcons.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DashIcons.jpg?resize=462%2C268" alt="Dashicons" class="size-full wp-image-8610" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dashicons &#8211; Which One Is The Hamburger Menu Icon?</p></div>\n<p><strong>Scott Reilly</strong> &#8211; The icons are Dashicons: <a href="http://melchoyce.github.io/dashicons/" title="http://melchoyce.github.io/dashicons/">http://melchoyce.github.io/dashicons/</a>, some of which were tweaked or custom-made for the site. While I wasn&#8217;t involved in the primary design itself, the sidebar of job types is a better presentation than the block of links that appeared at the top of the page. As Mel said, the use of the icons help reinforce the job types and branding, and it gives the site some graphical pizzazz.</p>\n<p><strong>Was the site ever powered by bbPress, or is it entirely driven by WordPress?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scott Reilly</strong> &#8211; I can only speak definitively to the previous and current incarnations of the site, but there isn&#8217;t any current use of bbPress nor have I seen any indication that bbPress ever powered any part of the site. The site is currently solely powered by WordPress.</p>\n<p><strong>What other enhancements do you have in store for the site in the near future?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Mel Choyce</strong></p>\n<p>The mantra for stage one of the redesign was get something done and ship it. Now that we&#8217;ve pushed version one out the door, we&#8217;ve started discussing and working on future enhancements. One of the first things we&#8217;re doing is working on applying better responsive styles. We&#8217;ve also talked about throwing new jobs into a single table on the homepage, instead of listing per category, but we haven&#8217;t really decided on anything yet. It&#8217;s an ongoing WIP.</p>\n<p><strong>Scott Reilly</strong> &#8211; Our primary goal and focus has been to get the new design launched. We managed just about everything we wanted to include and then some, having kept our goals modest. We still need to make a few tweaks to get it fully mobile-friendly. We&#8217;ll be releasing the theme soon via the meta.svn repository (also viewable at: <a href="http://meta.trac.wordpress.org/browser/" title="http://meta.trac.wordpress.org/browser/">http://meta.trac.wordpress.org/browser/</a>) as part of our efforts to open source the code of dotorg. We&#8217;re actually open to community requests via trac tickets at <a href="http://meta.trac.wordpress.org/report/1" title="http://meta.trac.wordpress.org/report/1">http://meta.trac.wordpress.org/report/1</a> (there&#8217;s a jobs.wordpress.net component) and eventually community patches.</p>\n<h2>What Does Mark Think?</h2>\n<p>After the announcement was published of the redesign, I sent an email to Mark Ghosh to get his thoughts. He approved of the new look and considered it a worthy upgrade. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/bfFRfLUm4VM" height="1" width="1"

results</a> from the Dashboard survey. There were 438 responses which is a good sample to start from but Dave mentions that the survey has biased results as most of the people who participated were developers. Knowing that the majority of responses were from the developer community, the results don&#8217;t surprise me one bit.</p>\n<p>Out of 416 answers, when asked <em>Which sections of the Dashboard do you never use (and think should go away?)</em> Other WordPress News took first place with 79% of the vote with QuickPress a very close second at 78% they were within 3 votes of each other. WordPress Blog, Plugins, and Incoming Links were generally close to taking the third spot. I would have thought that the Welcome Screen would have the least amount of votes to be removed but the Recent Comments widget claimed that position. <span id="more-8591"></span></p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DashboardSurveyQuestion2Results.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8592" alt="Question 2 Results For Dashboard Survey" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DashboardSurveyQuestion2Results.jpg?resize=500%2C217" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Question 3</strong> asked, <em>How often do you post with QuickPress</em>? it&#8217;s almost comical to see the response of <strong>Never</strong> take 92% of the vote.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DashboardSurveyQuestion3Results.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8593" alt="Question 3 Results" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DashboardSurveyQuestion3Results.jpg?resize=500%2C120" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Question 4</strong> asked <em>What sort of modifications do you typically make to the Dashboard (for yourself or for clients), and why?</em> There is no illustration since the results are text-based but the CSV containing the responses is <a title="http://cl.ly/3f2y1e0T1o09" href="http://cl.ly/3f2y1e0T1o09">publicly available</a>. I browsed through the document and was not surprised at the amount of people who remove most of the Dashboard widgets or completely redesign the Dashboard to fit their project.</p>\n<p><strong>Question 5</strong> asked <em>If you could wave a magic wand, what types of things would you show on the Dashboard?</em> These answers are also <a title="http://cl.ly/1H1b391L3N3Y" href="http://cl.ly/1H1b391L3N3Y">publicly available</a> as a CSV file and I thought were interesting. The majority of answers revolve around the idea of creating a Quicklinks Dashboard widget that would enable a quick way to accomplish common tasks. For example: <em>A widget called &#8220;I would like to&#8230;&#8221; with a list of common tasks (add new post/page/media/theme/plugin, moderate comments, etc.) that would take the user straight to that section of wp-admin;&#8221;</em> While you can&#8217;t access all tasks within the Dashboard, the Admin Bar already facilitates a quick way to create a new Post, Media, Page, User, Role, and if you have GravityForms installed, Forms. I wonder if the Admin bar is not being seen, is not being used, or simply isn&#8217;t the answer.</p>\n<p>Stats were another popular suggestion for the Dashboard whether it was the stats that come with Jetpack or Google Analytics, a lot of people just want to see stats right on the Dashboard.</p>\n<h2>My Thoughts:</h2>\n<p>Taking into consideration that many of the survey respondents are developers and consultants, many of their answers correlate with what they commonly experience with clients. The issue I take with those responses is that I&#8217;m not a client. Reading over the survey responses, I get the feeling that people need a ton of hand holding to get anything done or to navigate anywhere within the WordPress back-end. Maybe that&#8217;s the case but not for me. Some people even suggested to just get rid of the entire Dashboard concept and just forward people to the post creation screen or the settings screen depending on the user role.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think the Dashboard concept needs to be completely rethought. Not only thinking about how the current implementation can be improved, but also what is the Dashboard really supposed to accomplish? Let&#8217;s also dedicate some time and discussion in creating an all new Dashboard concept just to see where it goes.</p>\n<p>The more I think about it, the more I&#8217;d like to see the Dashboard function just like the Dashboard in my car. Give me warnings or caution signs of things that don&#8217;t seem right such as a page or link that is causing 404 errors for people, the average page load on the site increasing to an unacceptable level, etc. The Right Now box in the current implementation is the most important meta box for me. I feel that if information such as what I see in the Unpublished Content meta box from Edit Flow and the Site Stats was combined into the Right Now box, it would be much more useful and cut down the number of metaboxes on the screen. I&#8217;d like to be able to use the Right Now box to view trends on the site as well as be able to act on those trends. In fact, let&#8217;s get rid of the Right Now box and just call the whole thing Dashboard. One metabox filled with all kinds of information. Not sure how well tabs would work here because one box would quickly get cluttered with <strong>TOO MUCH</strong> information. As a site administrator, I want to see all of the information I can. This wouldn&#8217;t work for other user roles. I&#8217;d like to see user roles with fewer capabilities get a slimmed down version of what&#8217;s presented on the Dashboard. I think this already occurs to an extent where certain links are inaccessible based on capabilities.</p>\n<h2>Time To Get Involved:</h2>\n<p>The Dashboard revamp will take place as a plugin similar to how MP6 was developed. If you are interested in working on this plugin, you&#8217;re encouraged to leave a comment on the <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/08/21/3-8-dashboard-plugin/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/08/21/3-8-dashboard-plugin/">announcement post</a>. I love the fact that there is a discussion taking place about a major facet of WordPress and furthermore, that development will take place in a plugin rather than in core itself. I&#8217;m really digging these changes in the development approach of WordPress.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/zu6Ufr1o9yQ" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 11:00:26 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:52:"WPTavern: Photocrati Hires A Lead Happiness Engineer";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8573";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/wSWHHF_bTiI/photocrati-hires-a-lead-happiness-engineer";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3881:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/PhotocratiLogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/PhotocratiLogo.jpg?resize=164%2C39" alt="Photocrati Logo" class="alignright size-full wp-image-8588" /></a>Photocrati, the company behind NextGen Gallery has hired on a lead happiness engineer. Edward Caissie who is better known throughout the WordPress community as <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/cais" title="http://profiles.wordpress.org/cais">JellyBeen</a> was the person hired into the position. The hiring couldn&#8217;t have come at a better time considering how many people have <strong>NOT</strong> been happy with the latest version of the plugin which lead to the company <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/nextgen-gallery-creator-publishes-open-letter" title="http://www.wptavern.com/nextgen-gallery-creator-publishes-open-letter">publishing an open letter</a> to the community. I reached out to Edward to find out why he applied for the job and what his responsibilities will be. <span id="more-8573"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Why did I decide to take on a job with Photocrati?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, to be honest, I had been looking for a position with a WordPress-related company for some time and kept my eyes open for promising opportunities. The position as the Lead Happiness Engineer &#8211; NextGEN Gallery pretty much was made for me. I have over 20 years of Customer Service, 10+ years in web development, and I&#8217;ve spent the last five years or so honing my WordPress skills to a point where I was able to not only write themes and plugins but also help others to do the same. The job description just seem to hit all the points I was looking for as well.</p>\n<p>I get to work online, which basically means I get to work from home, or the cottage, or a coffee shop &#8230; anywhere there is decent Internet. There is also opportunity to grow with Photocrati.</p>\n<p><strong>In the midst of all the hoopla surrounding the latest release of NextGen Gallery, what will you be doing to calm down all of the upset people who have broken sites due to the update?</strong></p>\n<p>The thing is, we started talking back in February; long before any of the recent issues with NextGEN 2.0.x came to light. So I am on board with Photocrati to primarily help with Support. Mostly for paying customers but also for support (to a certain extent) of the free version of the NextGEN Gallery plugin as well. The opportunity to work with the developers is always there and as Photocrati grows more opportunities may become available as well.</p>\n<p>Most of my primary goals and fairly much most of my first days/weeks will be supporting customers and helping to get NextGEN to a much more stable release. I&#8217;ll be doing whatever I can to help out the customers, but to be quite honest NextGEN Gallery is a very large and quite complex plugin and when I am not helping customers I am delving into the code to learn its workings as well as offer any assistance and/or enhancements/improvements I find.</p>\n<p><strong>Is the position equal to that of the Automattic happiness engineer where your primary goal is to make customers happy?</strong></p>\n<p>Essentially, the &#8220;Happiness Engineer&#8221; part of the title is derived from Automattic&#8217;s ideals but being a much smaller organization the role definition is probably a bit more encompassing than what Automattic&#8217;s might be.</p>\n<p><strong>Edward has been a long-standing member of not only the WordPress community but of the WPTavern community as well. I congratulate him on getting a job he is happy with. If the lead happiness engineer is not happy, how would he be able to spread happiness to customers?</strong></p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/wSWHHF_bTiI" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 21 Aug 2013 21:44:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"WPTavern: The Daily Plugin â System Snapshots, Folder Slider, Harmonia, Content Blocks, String Locator";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8511";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:148:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/SAAiZagoHq0/the-daily-plugin-system-snapshots-folder-slider-harmonia-content-blocks-string-locator";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5917:"<p>It&#8217;s Wednesday which means it&#8217;s hump day and the week-end is in sight!

It provides you with quick-glance data that you can use to troubleshoot any issues you may be having with a WordPress installation. Data output includes version information for WordPress, PHP info, how your posts are displayed, how many users are active, etc. Essentially this is an all in one diagnostic and auditing tool that provides an entire snapshot of your entire WordPress operating environment. I&#8217;ve had plugins that provide some of this data, but this is the most comprehensive solution to show me all of the data I could possibly need to learn all about the internal structure of a unique WordPress installation.</p>\n<p><a title="Folder Slider" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/folder-slider/" target="_blank">Folder Slider</a> presents an alternative to the standard slider input. Generally sliders operate as being fed from either the Featured Image or as a separate slide management area within the slider plugin settings. This particular plugin is unique in that it instead pulls from a folder of images stored online to create the sliders. A basic set of transitions and options apply that allow you to present the images in a clean and aesthetically pleasing way. I&#8217;ve grown to appreciate plugins that feed directly from folders. Sometimes you just don&#8217;t need the extra management or setup that&#8217;s required when you simply want to display a slider of images without all the bells and whistles. This is a good no-frills option that can be updated simply by replacing the files in a folder via FTP.</p>\n<p><a title="Harmonia Inline MP3 Player" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/harmonia/" target="_blank">Harmonia</a> is a very interesting plugin that takes the new 3.6 inline player a bit further. This plugin finds all mp3 links in your content area and replaces the links with an inline audio player, allowing for instant listening. I like plugins that take all of the coding out of the post process, even if the coding is just a shortcode. When plugins like this come along, it makes it so much easier for WordPress novices to expand their content reach without requiring a speck of code. The player is in need of some more customization options, but it worked well for me in my staging tests thus far.</p>\n<p><a title="Content Blocks" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-content-blocks/" target="_blank">Content Blocks</a> is a mystery plugin from the wordpressdotorg team that is labeled as &#8220;<em>exploratory</em>&#8220;. This has me intrigued as I hope it does for you as well. I have no idea what it does or how it will work, but I&#8217;m going to find out. I can&#8217;t wait to see what&#8217;s inside the black box.</p>\n<p><a title="String Locator" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/string-locator/" target="_blank">String Locator</a> is something that I&#8217;ve been waiting for, for a long time. It performs a site-wide search of your themes and plugins for a specific string. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve been editing a theme or CSS file and missed at least one other instance that I needed to change, but could not locate. This plugin solves that problem by providing an easy to use search function to find all those needles in your theme&#8217;s haystack. It&#8217;s also good for spotting altered or malicious code that may appear from nowhere.</p>\n<p><a title="Export User Data" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/export-user-data/" target="_blank">Export User Data</a> gives you the option to export all of your user data into an Excel sheet for offline viewing. It includes options for exporting your users by role, a range of registration dates and usermeta options. It can export in both CSV and Excel formats. Data that can be exported also includes BuddyPress and bbPress profile data. I recently exported the BuddyPress profile data on a membership site run by a client. We then took the data to invite everyone on the site to connect to the site author on LinkedIn. Though it&#8217;s just one simple use, it is nice to have a full export capability that is not a full database.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;ll do &#8216;er for today&#8217;s plugin bonanza.

is getting pretty big, almost 200 folks now, spread all over the world. That&#8217;s a lot of people we can send to WordCamps. I remember when it was mostly Matt and I splitting up who&#8217;d go to which events &#8212; how times have changed in five years!</p>\n<p>Since we&#8217;re <a href="http://automattic.com/work-with-us/">hiring so enthusiastically</a>, my team is putting together a little guide for Automatticians on how to be an awesome Automattic representative at a WordCamp. I have a pretty giant list of tips and advice at the ready (you&#8217;d never have guessed, I know), but it occurs to me that non-Automatticians are probably the best people to ask about what we can do better when we pop in to a local WordCamp.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the things from my giant list so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t travel in packs.</strong> When there are a few or a bunch of Automatticians at an event, we tend to cluster together because we so rarely get to see each other &#8212; and we like each other &#8212; but it makes it less likely that we&#8217;ll meet new community members. 1. Because we&#8217;re too busy talking to each other to reach out to new people. 2. Because it&#8217;s intimidating for someone new to break into that group.</li>\n<li><strong>Ask questions.</strong> A lot of WordCamp attendees will already know about Automattic, so while we should definitely be a resource for anyone interested in the company, the better use of time is getting to know the community members: who are they, how are they using WordPress, what would help them make their community more vibrant, who are the local independent consultants/themers/developers that we should know about?</li>\n<li><strong>Help out.</strong> WordCamps are a lot of work. Automatticians aren&#8217;t visiting dignitaries &#8212; we&#8217;re getting paid to be there &#8212; and we should help out along with the locals, whether that&#8217;s taking a shift on the help desk, moving chairs, or passing out shirts.</li>\n<li><strong>Be identifiable.</strong> Wearing the same WordPress t-shirt as everyone else is cool and all, but wearing a shirt that identifies the wearer as an Automattic employee, or a lanyard for the badge or something, would make it easier for people interested in talking about Automattic (especially people interested in jobs!) to find the Automatticians in the crowd.</li>\n<li><strong>Carry cards.</strong> Saying &#8220;email me later&#8221; works better when the card with an email address is handed over at the same time. That said, getting community member contact info so the burden of follow-up isn&#8217;t on them is even better.</li>\n<li><strong>Tweet It.</strong>Â  Using Twitter to let local followers know Automatticians are there is helpful. They might love to meet in person and talk about working at Automattic or contributing to the .org project and may not realize we&#8217;re there, especially if we&#8217;re not on the speaker list.</li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t hog the speaker slots.</strong> Yes, Automatticians are speakers you can rely on, and we do employ a lot of seriously smart people, but if the speaker roster is filled up with Automatticians, that doesn&#8217;t do a lot to help grow the experience of local folks, which is part of what WordCamps are about.</li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t be exclusionary.</strong> If planning to go off to an Automattician dinner or something after a long day of not traveling as a pack, don&#8217;t make those plans in front of other people, who will feel excluded (or might not understand what&#8217;s happening and might inadvertently show up later and crash the dinner); make <em>private</em> plans in <em>private</em> via Automattic channels. Even better, don&#8217;t go to private dinners, go to dinner with members of the local community.</li>\n<li><strong>Be present.</strong> In sessions, don&#8217;t work on the laptop, just pay attention to the speaker. In the crowd, don&#8217;t focus on the phone, smile and meet new people. Be there for the whole event, don&#8217;t take off early or skip the second day. Show the local community that Automatticians are respectful and want to be there.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What would you add? In the comments (or in an email to me at jenmylo/wordpress.org if you don&#8217;t want people to see what you think) make suggestions for what Automatticians can do to be awesome at WordCamps. It&#8217;s also okay to give examples of times when we have not been awesome. Learning from our mistakes is good, too. Thanks in advance for your help!</p>\n<br />  <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=jenmylo.com&blog=45389656&post=1900&subd=jenmylo&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 16:24:14 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Jen Mylo";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"WPTavern: WordPress Category Now Available On Microlancer.com";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8516";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:113:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/W9xZwKqbsZU/wordpress-category-now-available-on-microlancer-com";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6972:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/microlancerlogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/microlancerlogo.jpg?resize=247%2C48" alt="MicrolancerLogo" class="alignright size-full wp-image-8517" /></a>Microlancer, an Envato owned company has <a href="http://www.microlancer.com/explore/wordpress" title="http://www.microlancer.com/explore/wordpress">recently added a WordPress category</a> for users needing work done to their WordPress site. The site has been in private beta since April of 2013 and helps build a bridge between freelancers and clients. The site currently has three different WordPress service categories available, <a href="http://www.microlancer.com/explore/website-to-wordpress" title="http://www.microlancer.com/explore/website-to-wordpress">Website to WordPress</a>, <a href="http://www.microlancer.com/explore/wordpress-customization" title="http://www.microlancer.com/explore/wordpress-customization">WordPress Customization</a>, <a href="http://www.microlancer.com/explore/wordpress-plug-ins" title="http://www.microlancer.com/explore/wordpress-plug-ins">WordPress Plug-ins</a>. Service Providers (freelancers who list their services and provide them for buyers) can choose a fixed price for their services, as well as a turnaround time that suits them. Buyers pay upfront. Any disputes are resolved fairly by Microlancer staff. Skellie was nice enough to answer two questions I had concerning the site. <span id="more-8516"></span></p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MicrolancerWPServices.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MicrolancerWPServices.jpg?resize=500%2C360" alt="WordPress Services On Microlancer" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8518" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s the biggest difference between using a job board and something like Microlancer?</strong></p>\n<p>You can find someone great much more quickly and with much less back and forth than you can using a job board. On Microlancer, prices are fixed and clearly visible, and each job states a turnaround time that the service provider must meet. Every listing includes visual examples of previous work, and a description of what is included in the service. There&#8217;s no time spent on trawling through copy and paste job bids, endless back and forth communication, trying to get a clear quote. Everything you need to know is stated upfront before you&#8217;ve paid a cent.</p>\n<p><strong>How will consumers be protected from people trying to rip them off?</strong></p>\n<p>When a buyer purchases a service on Microlancer, the funds don&#8217;t go straight to the service provider. Instead, they are kept in holding and only released when a job is successfully completed. If at any point during the job the client is unhappy with the work, they can start a dispute. Disputes are fairly resolved by Microlancer staff. A client will never be forced to pay for bad quality work, or bad service.</p>\n<div class="aligncenter"></div>\n<p>One thing I noticed on their <a href="http://www.microlancer.com/how-it-works" title="http://www.microlancer.com/how-it-works">How It Works</a> page is that clients receive a set number of revisions so you better know what you want before doing business. When asked who controls the number of revisions clients/customers receive, I was told that the seller controls the number of revisions as well as the turnaround time but the revisions were capped at 3. I was also curious to know whether customers can provide feedback through ratings or reviews and yes they can. Although not all services have reviews as they are optional from the buyer, <a href="https://www.microlancer.com/explore/business-card-design/588-creative-profession-business-card-designs" title="https://www.microlancer.com/explore/business-card-design/588-creative-profession-business-card-designs">here is an example</a> of a service that has both a recommendation percentage on the right-hand side and at least one review below the service description. </p>\n<h2>A Service Providers Perspective:</h2>\n<p>Microlancer is in its infancy but I was able to get in touch with at least one service provider to try to get their thoughts on using the service. They have only used it for a week or so but this is what they had to say:</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;ve had one project so far but I don&#8217;t see myself using it in the future unless I really spend some time prepackaging everything I do into little one-off services.</p>\n<p>The whole interface just doesn&#8217;t fit into a good mechanism for working with code. Perhaps my viewpoint is skewed as I do so much freelancing for WordPress on <a href="https://codeable.io/" title="https://codeable.io/">Codeable.io</a> (which is amazing for WordPress freelancing).</em></p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate the experience of dealing with clients via Microlancer?</strong></p>\n<p>Poor. No live chat so the back and forth is slow. My single experience with a project so far has been that the client didn&#8217;t actually read the description of the service and instead just read the title and went off that. So while my description said &#8216;<em>12 specific style changes</em>&#8216;, what he wanted was something different. As of right now the project status is unknown to me. We had a bit of back and forth to clarify what he wanted, I agreed and now have not heard anything. The project was &#8220;<em>started</em>&#8221; but I assume I&#8217;ll need to contact support to have the project cancelled.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your general observation of the service?</strong></p>\n<p>Very mixed feelings. It&#8217;s nice to have another option for freelancing and one at which I can just list my services and wait for clients to pick them is enticing. However it doesn&#8217;t seem to have a good mechanism in place for scope creep, additional feature/service requests or a good client interaction.</p>\n<h2>My Thoughts:</h2>\n<p>Cruising around the site looking over the various services being provided, I think Microlancer is a great idea. There seems to be a WordPress service for everything such as customizing the WordPress login screen to modifying an existing design into a responsive layout. However, it will only be as good as the work clients receive. Collis Taâeed CEO of Envato has had an abundant amount of success with the likes of <a href="http://themeforest.net/" title="http://themeforest.net/">ThemeForest</a> and <a href="http://codecanyon.net/" title="http://codecanyon.net/">CodeCanyon</a>. Will Microlancer be another feather in his cap?</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, concerns, or general feedback for Microlancer, feel free to share it in the comments as representatives will be monitoring the comment section. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/W9xZwKqbsZU" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 16:00:32 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"WPTavern: WordPress Radio â WPR.FM â Get Involved";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8543";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/FUVmCnHe2JM/wordpress-radio-wpr-fm-get-involved";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5229:"<p>Since my involvement in WordPress some 9 years ago, I followed the various audio and video productions pertaining to WordPress with great interest. As the technology of podcasting became more prevalent and easier to produce, there were many new productions about WordPress that came and went. Recently though, there have been a lot of really good shows that have been released on a regular basis that have provided a well-rounded set of listening choices. I believe the time has come to engage in a community based strategic alliance of these shows in the form of a 24/7 streaming audio station. <span id="more-8543"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Thus, the formation of <a title="WordPress Radio" href="http://wpr.fm">WPR.FM</a>.

As a podcaster of 8+ years, streaming was always viewed as the &#8220;old&#8221; way of doing things. This was more commonly profiled due to lack of bandwidth or mobile portability. Nowadays with modern carrier technology able to stream anywhere we are, I feel the stars have aligned to create an audio channel that&#8217;s all ours. I approached my friend &#8220;Mr. Oil&#8221; who runs <a title="Fralnet" href="http://fralnet.com">FralNet</a>, a UK-based host provider and he liked the idea so much that he graciously offered to help get us up and running at no cost! He helped me with the setup, and in 10 minutes, we were streaming to the world!</p>\n<p>Now that the connections were made and the &#8220;on-air light&#8221; has been illuminated, it&#8217;s time to get the DJ&#8217;s in their proper rotation. Ideally we would like to see the following shows in the programming lineup: <a title="WordPress Weekly" href="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-weekly">WordPress Weekly</a> with Jeff Chandler, <a title="Wordpress Plugins A-Z Podcast" href="http://wppluginsatoz.com">WordPress Plugins A-Z</a> with John Overall and Marcus Couch, <a title="Your Website Engineer" href="http://yourwebsiteengineer.com/">Your Website Engineer</a> with Dustin Hartzler, <a title="The WordPress Chick" href="http://thewpchick.com">The WordPress Chick</a> with Kim Doyal, <a title="WP Water Cooler" href="http://www.wpwatercooler.com/">WP Watercooler</a> with Chris Lema, Jeff Tucker and cast, <a title="DradCast" href="http://dradcast.com/">DradCast</a> with Brad Williams and Dre Armeda, <a title="Matt Report" href="http://mattreport.com/">Matt Report</a> with Matt Medeiros, <a title="Weekly Web Tools" href="http://weeklywebtools.com">Weekly Web Tools</a> with Dave Jackson and others like <a title="WP Bacon" href="http://wpbacon.com/">WP Bacon</a>, <a title="Apply Filters" href="http://applyfilters.fm/">Apply Filters</a> and my own 3 minute news segment of The Daily Plugin. And that&#8217;s just who I listen to. There are probably tons more that I am missing.</p>\n<p>From an additional content perspective, how cool would it be to get Q&amp;A segments from WordCamps or Meetup Groups? How about a monthly &#8220;Industry Night&#8221; show where <strong>EVERYONE</strong> who produces a show all gets on a call and goes around the table talking WordPress? I think our community would get a lot of benefit from this. We also have the ability to stream live, so the possibilities are only limited by what content is available to us.</p>\n<h2>So we have a WordPress stream, now what?</h2>\n<p><strong>Site Design and Development</strong><br />\nThe next phase will be site builds and profiles for all the content, shows and presenters. This is where I am looking for the community for help. If this is a project that you believe has merit and you&#8217;d like to volunteer to help with the site build, please let me know.</p>\n<p><strong>App Creation</strong><br />\nIf you have experience in APP development for both Android and iOS and would like to work on the APP project with us, we welcome your participation there as well. Our goal is to create a free stream companion app that can be played on the go and have all the appropriate show information about both content and hosts.</p>\n<p><strong>Content Programming</strong><br />\nWe&#8217;re looking for help with programming the station as well. As we start receiving more submitted content from the WordPress Community, it will be important to keep a high standard with regards to the production elements. We&#8217;d like to make this a professional station with station IDs, show introductions/lead-ins and fresh WP news content every day. If you are an experienced audio editor, we would enjoy your participation as well.</p>\n<p>For everyone else, I invite you to tune in! The stream is already live and can be listened to on our splash page one any device, in any format.</p>\n<p>So what do you think of the concept? Let me know what ideas you have and what I may have missed.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/FUVmCnHe2JM" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 11:00:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Marcus Couch";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"WordPress.tv: ÐÐ½Ð½Ð° ÐÐ°Ð´Ð¾ÑÐºÐ¸Ð½Ð°: ÐÐ´Ð°Ð¿ÑÐ¸Ð²Ð½ÑÐ¹ ÐºÐ¾Ð½ÑÐµÐ½Ñ Ð² WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=21497";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/20/anna-ladoshkina-responsive-content-in-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:709:"<div id="v-ywKdvX3M-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/21497/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/21497/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=21497&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/20/anna-ladoshkina-responsive-content-in-wordpress/"><img alt="ÐÐ½Ð½Ð° ÐÐ°Ð´Ð¾ÑÐºÐ¸Ð½Ð°: ÐÐ´Ð°Ð¿ÑÐ¸Ð²Ð½ÑÐ¹ ÐºÐ¾Ð½ÑÐµÐ½Ñ Ð² WordPress" src="http://videos.videopress.com/ywKdvX3M/video-1a1cc42cfc_scruberthumbnail_1.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 09:17:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"WPTavern: Better Wording Needed For After The Deadline Prompt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8562";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:113:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/axRljp_6i7M/better-wording-needed-for-after-the-deadline-prompt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1814:"<p>I&#8217;ve used the After The Deadline service for a long time.

I proofread almost every post before it&#8217;s published. However, I&#8217;ve recently been struck by the wording of the AtD prompt once I schedule or publish a post.

There have been at least a couple of instances where I have pressed OK thinking that the After The Deadline spell checker would Update my post with the necessary corrections or, allow me to actually update the errors in the post but instead, end up publishing the post. I think the most important wording that needs to be changed is the part that says &#8220;<em>Press OK To Update Your Post</em>&#8220;.  So I&#8217;m throwing this out to everyone else to not only see how many people have mistakenly pressed OK only to have their post be published or scheduled, but also ask what do you think the wording of this prompt should be changed to? While were at it, perhaps I&#8217;m the only one screwing things up around here and it&#8217;s not really a problem. After all, I believe the prompt has been this way for a long time.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/axRljp_6i7M" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 05:09:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"Lorelle on WP: Fall 2013 WordPress College Courses";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/?p=10115";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2013/08/19/fall-2013-wordpress-college-courses/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:521:"Registration is now open for the two WordPress college courses I teach at Clark College in Vancouver, Washington, and Portland Community College at Rock Creek in Beaverton, just west of Portland, Oregon.

There is also a plugin <a title="http://poststat.us/a-b-testing-wordpress/" href="http://poststat.us/a-b-testing-wordpress/">mentioned by PostStat.us</a> called AB Press Optimizer. WP-ABTesting took some time out to answer a few questions I had about their service. <span id="more-8521"></span></p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPABTestingLogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8531" alt="WP AB Testing Logo" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPABTestingLogo.jpg?resize=435%2C75" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Tell us a bit about the WP AB Testing service.</strong></p>\n<p>We provide a <span>native</span> conversion optimization service for WordPress sites. Our aim is to increase your conversion rates (whatever your conversion goal is: more sign-ups, sales, visitors,&#8230;) in a systematic and scientific way. Opinions are great but only if they are used to start a data-driven experiment to (dis)prove them before deciding on whether to implement them or not. Nobody (not even you) is good enough to predict what will work for your site.</p>\n<p>At the core of our service you have an A/B testing (also known as split testing) mechanism. In its simplest form, A/B testing works by predefining two or more alternatives for a given post or page and the conversion goal you want to achieve with them, and then randomly showing those alternatives to your visitors to check which one works better, i.e. which one has a higher conversion rate. For instance, you may want to create two alternative versions of your landing page, show 50% of the time each alternative and monitor which one makes more of your visitors to sign-up for your mailing list. Once the results are statistically significant (donât be scared, we will hide all the math from you, just keep reading!) you consolidate the winning alternative and start again with a new test.</p>\n<p><strong>What will WP AB Testing have that may not be found in plugins or other similar services?</strong></p>\n<p>Most tools focus on the classic AB testing: you define the tests and the tools report on the number of conversions of each alternative. We believe this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>\n<p>Our service goes beyond this in two main directions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>-</strong> Technical level. We donât want to restrict people to test only posts / pages with a standard AB Testing algorithm. Since our service is a native WordPress solution we can offer fine-grained tests in which other WordPress components (like menus, widgets or the theme itself) can be tested as well. Then, the plug-in automatically evolves the site based on the results of those tests (obviously, only if you want the plug-in to do that for you). Weâll also complement A/B testing with other testing / optimization strategies like greedy algorithms and heat maps to offer a better picture of whatâs going on in the site. Another example we have in our future roadmap is to enable the use of social metrics as conversion goals (i.e. an alternative post is better if it gets reshared more times) which we believe can be interesting for some sites.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>-</strong> Personalization level. Raw data on the percentage of improvement of an alternative may be enough for math savvy users but wonât do much for the rest. We believe in A/B testing for everybody which means that our service will help people to understand the meaning of the numbers they see to make an informed decision. And, more importantly, for those that want a more hassle-free experience, we will offer a personalized service where one of our company experts will suggest possible tests for your site (e.g. based on ours and the community experience on what has worked in other sites in the same domain) and even create and monitor the tests for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why is AB Testing an important practice to conduct on websites from time to time?</strong></p>\n<p>First, I&#8217;d like to âchallengeâ the fact that AB Testing should be done âfrom time to timeâ. In our opinion, you should always be optimizing your site. Even if some optimizations may only bring a small improvement, they add up so the overall effect may well surprise you!.</p>\n<p>A second reason, which is not usually mentioned, is that you are going to learn a lot about your site and your business when doing A/B tests. Many  people regard A/B tests as mere small changes on the look and feel of your site (e.g. changing the color of a button here, increasing the size of an image there,&#8230;) but they can be much more powerful than that. I regard them as a learning tool for the business owner. Just thinking about possible tests gives you a perfect excuse to reconsider your business assumptions and offers a low-risk approach to test alternative approaches that otherwise you would have never dared to try. And if the test fails (meaning that your current version doesnât need to be changed) you should even be happier. Failed tests are as useful as successful ones. They allow you to get rid of possible scenarios that now you know for sure wouldnât work.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPABTesting1.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPABTesting1.jpg?resize=500%2C171" alt="WP ABTesting Service" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8539" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Why the decision to turn WP AB Testing into a dedicated service instead of a fully featured plugin?</strong></p>\n<p>We try to combine the best of both worlds: a WP plug-in on the âclientâ side that the user can install to define the tests, see the graphics with the results, consolidate the winning alternative,&#8230; all without leaving the WordPress environment (meaning there is no need to learn a new tool) plus an external back-end that takes care of recording and processing all the relevant data to evaluate the performance of the alternatives tested.</p>\n<p>We believe this makes a lot of sense, again both at the technical and business level. On the technical side we lift all the processing load from your own server so that the tests do not slow down your site or interfere with your hosting provider limits. On the business side, because an ongoing relationship is needed to be able to advise you on your best testing strategy (by checking what has worked and what hasnât worked so far for you), on new tests that we believe could be specially useful for you, etc. </p>\n<p>Donât forget that A/B Testing is only the means to an end (optimize your conversions) and not the end itself. Our mission is to make sure you bring your site to the next level, not just to provide you with a tool to do all the work on your own.</p>\n<p><strong>How can people be notified and participate in the beta?</strong></p>\n<p>Just go to our <a href="http://wp-abtesting.com/" title="http://wp-abtesting.com/">website</a> and join our <a href="http://wp-abtesting.com/sign-up-for-our-free-beta/" title="http://wp-abtesting.com/sign-up-for-our-free-beta/">mailing list</a> in less than 30 seconds.

The changelog for Jetpack is usually a mile long but in this case, I was happy to see that the Widget Visibility module was added to Jetpack. Widget Visibility was made available to WordPress.com earlier this year.  Now Available In Jetpack As I mentioned in my initial post discussing the feature, the interface is surprisingly simple to use. In 2011, I shared my thoughts on what I think would work for a widget control interface.  Iâm thinking of a plugin thatâs a cross between Widget Logic and Widget Context. This plugin should work on the premise that anytime a widget is added to a sidebar, itâs viewable across the entire site where that sidebar loads. UI is added to the widget screen so that I can easily search or choose from the various template files that make up my theme to decide where the widget will be displayed. By specifically configuring where the widget will be displayed, Iâve also configured where it will not be displayed. Iâm not quite sure which user interface would work best for selecting more than one area where the widgets will be displayed, perhaps the check box method that already exists in Widget Context. This is about all Iâd need to satisfy my needs. Itâs simple, not many options and I think covers the basis for a lot of uses. Now, if Kaspars or users suggested that they wanted rules, or more complex ways of telling their widgets where to show up or hide, I would not complain about having an Advanced tab that showed additional options. But I definitely donât want that clutter in view as part of the default configuration UI. What I requested in 2011 is not far from what Widget Visibility offers. Instead of choosing template files within a theme, I can choose between category, author, tag, date, page which are theme agnostic and cover the gamut of options Iâd need to hide or show a widget. Iâm glad they didnât listen to me when I described the interface. I only wish something this simple would have been added to WordPress a long time ago. What something like Widget Visibility offers is an easy way to make one sidebar serve multiple purposes without needing to create separate sidebars with specific widgets. This opens up a lot more versatility for displaying widgets. While Iâm still excited to see this piece of functionality accessible to a large audience through Jetpack, I canât help but think about how much more exciting it would have been to see this as an added feature back in the WordPress 3.0 days.  Now I can retire the Widget Logic plugin which required me to know WordPress conditional tags in order to control when and where widgets displayed.

Building a Successful UX Process</a></li><li><a class=''rsswidget'' href=''http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/oqbc1vm7NYc/automatic-updates-possible-in-wordpress-3-7'' title=''As was stated by Matt Mullenweg in his State Of The Word 2013 at WordCamp San Francisco, one of the goals for WordPress was to perform automatic updates similar to the Chrome browser. That is, perform automatic updates without breaking anything to the point where you donât even know the software has updated. On the Make WordPress Core blog, we find out how this will possibly become a reality with WordPress 3.7. A plugin created by Pento called Automatic Updater will be used as the framework to provide this functionality. The first step is for the automation of minor releases. For example 3.7 to 3.7.1 would happen automatically. Andrew Nacin outlines a number of tickets that need to be addressed surrounding this functionality.  One of the first comments on that blog post is from Joshua Strebel, CEO of Page.ly which is a large managed WordPress hosting service. Please consider an opt-out constant/mechanism simply for those of us that run multi-tenancy and manage the entire core package from the top down. Andrew followed up by noting there will be a mechanism to opt out which will not be accessible from the user interface. Instead, it will most likely be a filter or a constant to not only opt-out of upgrades, but also to enable upgrading to major releases as well in case you wanted full-blown automation. However, they are looking for more feedback from hosting companies and are encouraging them to follow the development of this feature.  Back around September of 2011, I asked whether Automatic upgrades for WordPress should be opt-in? Out of 210 votes, 67% or 141 said yes while 69 voted no. At the time, I felt like WordPress wanted to hold my hand too much when it came to managing my install. However, I am completely fine with automatic upgrades to minor releases leaving me to upgrade to major versions when I feel comfortable doing so. The conversation in the comments following the poll are worth a read, even if the conversation was two years ago. It would be interesting to hear from those who participated in that conversation to see if their views have changed, especially since we now know that the default upgrade functionality will be for minor releases.  Iâm just thinking you might want to consider more than the most obvious point of view about upgrades. When was the last time you upgraded Chrome? Did you know it upgraded itself, about twice a week? Did you notice? Did you care? Thatâs the kind of thing I think we should shoot for. You shouldnât notice upgrades, they should just happen. And not fail, of course. â Otto Hmm, Otto mentioned the way Chrome upgrades in 2011, Matt talks about it as the model for WordPress in 2013 and thatâs the way weâre headed. Perhaps Otto has a future telling crystal skull?

Over the years, a number of people have subscribed to the iTunes feed provided by Talkshoe. Starting this week, I will no longer be using the Talkshoe iTunes feed but rather, my own. I encourage you to subscribe to the new WordPress Weekly iTunes subscription link as all new episodes will be published through it. This frees me from having to be attached to a service to use an iTunes link and as long as iTunes doesnât shut down, this should be the last time youâll have to change subscription links. Alternatively, if you want to subscribe to the show via RSS feed, you can do so through the following URL http://www.wptavern.com/feed/podcast  As a bonus, check out the brand new piece of Podcast cover art for the show created by Becky Crockett of PodcastDesigns.com. Be warned, the full size image is 1400 X 1400. Becky was a treat to work with and was recommended to me via Marcus Couch.   What do you think?

Although there is no industry standard for the contents of such a plan, Securitysense has recommended organizations by using a model that has proved to be an effective communication tool with the numerous interested parties (including senior management), as well as a reasonable tracking mechanism for multiyear progress reports. While the model can be applied by organizations of any size and in any industry, the details vary based on the scale of the organization and the starting maturity level of the various effected organizational units.</span></span></p>\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The information security strategic plan should not be viewed as a stand-alone document. It should exist as one part of a set of planning documents that start with a charter and a vision statement, but that also extends beyond the strategic plan into tactical and communications plans. Each of these has a role in providing context and action ability for the strategic plan. Organizations that have an established enterprise architecture (EA) function should leverage the existing EA disciplines, processes and standards to ensure that the strategic plan for information security is aligned with the EA strategy (see "Architecting Security: Different Approaches"). Securitysense generally considers three years to be an appropriate window for strategic planning for information security. The charter and vision statements deal with longer-term directions, while the tactical and communications plans specify single-year operational considerations and projects.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The basic layout of the strategic plan is:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Introduction and executive summary</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Strategic plan framework description</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Current state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Desired state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Gap analysis</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Prioritization plan</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Roles and responsibilities</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Introduction and Executive Summary</b></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The introduction should be written first, setting the purpose and scope of the document.

Frameworks for this purpose can be derived from industry standards, from Securitysense research or from a combination of the two. </span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some sources for framework structure and contents are:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Controls</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electro technical</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Commission (IEC) 27002</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-53</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Architecture</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO10181</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO13335</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Processes</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO/IEC 27001</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</span></span>\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In addition, Securitysense research can provide significant examples and guidelines for constructing such a framework (see the Recommended Reading section below). Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Part of the three-year strategic plan should be guidance to tactical planners on how to prioritize the closure of those gaps, such that any natural order is optimized. Controls determine what should be achieved, but controls become meaningful only if the governance structure is functional. The IT organization needs direction via technical architecture to be efficient, but architecture requires guidance from controls. Operational processes related to technologies that are already in place depend, to some degree, on controls (what processes and technologies are needed) and architecture (which process elements and technologies are automated). As a result, a normal prioritization plan might be to start with governance, move to controls, then architecture and finally process. But this is a "greenfield" approach, and it may not be appropriate for organizations with variable levels of maturity in the current information security program or IT organizations in general. For example, a lack of maturity in strategic processes, such as risk assessment and security communications, which are not technology-dependent may demand earlier prioritization.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore, the method by which priorities will be assigned in the tactical plans requires some</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">strategic guidance. More-granular prioritization of work should be included in tactical (annual) planning documents, and should be based on criteria such as the relative risk impact, the cost, the mean time to value and the availability of resources.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This section describes who is responsible for delivering and who is responsible for approving each strategic and tactical deliverable that results from this strategic plan. There are four sets of organizational areas that need to be mapped to deliverables and action plans:</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The security office</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Lines of business (LOBs) or federation issues (responsibilities that reside with persons or departments </span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">that are affiliated with, but not reporting to, the central information security function)</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The IT organization</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Other business areas (typically, the functions that go on in headquarters, such as legal, HR and finance)</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The security office''s responsibilities should be easily extracted from the security charter. The authority, rights and obligations of LOB management and the IT organization should have been negotiated via the governance structure prior to, or as part of, the creation of this strategic plan. These authorities, rights and obligations are typically governed via some kind of information security steering committee. Other business areas may be surprised by their inclusion or may have expressed a need for involvement on their own, typically as a response to regulatory compliance needs.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One approach to documenting these roles and responsibilities that has been widely accepted by organization is the use of a responsible, accountable, consulted and informed (RACI) matrix. Once all these steps have been outlined, the executive summary can be written.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Security Strategy', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '398-autosave-v1', '', '', '2013-08-29 08:32:13', '2013-08-29 08:32:13', '', 398, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?p=511', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Be exceptionally careful if a request is made with an urgent or threatening tone. Criminals use this trick to get your personal and/or account information to access your accounts or commit identity theft.\r\n\r\nIf youâre suspicious of any request, you should directly contact the company whose name is used in making the request to confirm the request is valid. If you think youâve provided personal or account information in response to a fraudulent email or website, change your password and any other authentication information (e.g. challenge questions, secret questions, etc.) and monitor your account activity frequently.\r\n\r\n<strong>Use anti-virus and anti-malware software</strong>\r\n\r\nMake sure your computer has anti-virus and anti-malware protection software installed. This protects you against malicious software (also known as âmalwareâ) and computer viruses. Ensure these programs are set to automatically update daily. Also, make sure your software is set up to scan all email attachments..\r\n\r\n<strong>Don''t respond to suspicious ("phishing") emails</strong>\r\n\r\nCriminals send out fake emails to random email addresses hoping to reach real customers. These emails are called âphishingâ emails. Itâs one of the ways criminals try to trick customers into giving personal information (account numbers, passwords, etc.).\r\n\r\nIf an email appears to be from Valley Bank but looks suspicious, forward it to us at <a href="https://www.myvalleybank.com/email.htm?customerservice@myvalleybank.com" target="_self">customer service@myvalleybank.com</a> then delete it immediately from your inbox. Do not open email attachments or click links in emails if you do not personally know the sender. Instead of clicking a link in an email, type the URL directly in your browser. Or use âfavoritesâ to access the website.\r\n\r\n<strong>Beware of suspicious ("spoofing") websites</strong>\r\n\r\nCriminals create fake websites that look like real company websites in order to steal your personal information. Be cautious of links sent to you in emails. âPhishingâ emails include links to these fake sites. The best way to know that you are going to the real website is to type the URL directly in your browser or use âfavoritesâ to access the website. As a rule of thumb, when entering personal information on a site look at the website address to be sure it starts with âhttpsâ.\r\n\r\n<strong>Keep up with updates on your personal compute</strong>r\r\n\r\nUpdated software helps protect against vulnerabilities. Install updates offered by your operating system and software provider(s) and use a current web browser.\r\n\r\n<strong>Donât share personal information on social networking sites</strong>\r\n\r\nSocial networks such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and MySpace allow you to share your information online. However there are pieces of information you should always keep to yourself. Think carefully about sharing your Social Security Number (including the last 4 digits), date of birth, personal phone number, home address, or where you were born. Criminals can collect this information and use it to open accounts in your name.\r\n\r\n<strong>Verify online requests for money by friends or contacts are real</strong>\r\n\r\nBe extremely wary of people youâre connected to on social networks that ask for money through instant message (IM) or email. Fraudsters have been known to hack into social networks and assume the identity of a real user, then send messages to all of their contacts stating the person has been robbed or is stranded somewhere and needs you to wire money in order to get home. If you receive one of these requests, contact the person by phone and verify the request is real.\r\n\r\n<strong>Avoid downloading files from unknown sources</strong>\r\n\r\nMalicious software (also known as âmalwareâ) and computer viruses can be hidden in email attachments and other files downloaded from the Internet. Before you download anything, verify you trust the source. Even when you receive files from friends and family, make sure your anti-virus software scans the files before opening them.\r\n<strong>ONLINE SECURITY TIPS</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Go paperless and use online services</strong>\r\n\r\nYou have secure access to your accounts when youâre online. Here are examples of online services that can help protect you against fraud:\r\n\r\nâ¢ 24/7 account access - Accessing your accounts online helps you to detect identity crime earlier than if you only received paper statements monthly.\r\n\r\nâ¢ Account Alerts - Setting up email alerts about account activity lets you identify fraud quickly.\r\n\r\nâ¢ Electronic statements - Receiving your statements online instead of in the mail reduces the risk of mail fraud.\r\n\r\nAlways verify you are on a secure site before you enter your username and password. The address of a secure site begins with âhttps,â rather than âhttp.â It is OK for a home page to begin with âhttpâ but you should always make sure youâre on an âhttpsâ page before entering your password. You can also read security details of sites by "double-clicking" on the padlock icon located at the top or bottom of your browser window. View the security certificate and make sure it matches the site.\r\n\r\n<strong>Log off when you''re done</strong>\r\n\r\nAlways log off from your online session when youâre done. This will help prevent anyone else using that computer from accessing your information.\r\n\r\n<strong>PASSWORD &amp; PIN SECURITY TIPS</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Create strong passwords</strong>\r\n\r\nUse passwords and personal identification numbers (PINs) that are easy to remember but hard for others to guess. Using a combination of upper case and lower case letters along with numbers and special characters makes your password more secure. Names, birthdays and common phrases are easy for others to guess. While we do not force password changes it is best practice for you to change your password at least every 60 to 90 days. Choose different passwords for each of your online accounts and change them frequently.', 'How to Protect Yourself Online', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-to-protect-yourself-online', '', '', '2013-07-09 11:14:54', '2013-07-09 11:14:54', '', 0, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?page_id=245', 0, 'page', '', 0),

When they use the credit cards and don''t pay the bills, the delinquency is reported on your credit report.</li>\r\n	<li>Establishing phone or cellular service in your name.</li>\r\n	<li>Opening a bank account in your name and writing bad checks on the account.</li>\r\n	<li>Counterfeiting checks or debit cards, and draining your bank account.</li>\r\n	<li>Buying cars by taking out auto loans in your name.</li>\r\n	<li>Calling your credit card issuer and, pretending to be you, changing the address on the account. Bills get sent to the new address, so you don''t realize there''s a problem until you check your credit report.</li>\r\n	<li>Filing for bankruptcy using your name to avoid paying debts they''ve incurred under your name.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>What can you do if you are a Victim of Identity Theft?</h4>\r\nThe following items are included in your credit file.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Keep a record.</strong>Â  Because recovering from identity theft can be a long and complicated process, it''s important to keep a record of all of your communications. Send all letters by certified mail and keep copies.Â  If you think your case might lead to a lawsuit, keep track of how much time you spend dealing with the problem.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Call the police. </strong>Report the crime to the police or sheriff''s department that has jurisdiction in your case and request a police report. Though the authorities are often unable to assist you, a police report may be necessary to help convince creditors that someone else has opened an account in your name.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Contact the Federal Trade Commission.</strong> Call the FTC''s identity theft hotline at 877-438-4338 and file a complaint. The FTC does not resolve individual consumer problems itself, but your complaint may lead to law enforcement action.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Check your credit reports.</strong> Get your credit reports from all three nationwide credit reporting agencies and check for inquiries that youÂ do not recognize and any new accounts opened in your name. Because new accounts may take up to six months to show up on the report, continue to monitor your credit reports on a regular basis.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Contact one of the three Nationwide Credit Reporting Agencies to place a fraud alert.</strong> Have one of the agencies put a fraud alert on your file, which will aid in preventing new credit accounts from being opened without your express permission. Equifax and the other two credit reporting agencies, Experian and TransUnion, work together so that when you place an alert with one of these agencies, your request is automatically sent to the other two agencies (see information about <a href="https://www.myvalleybank.com/notice.htm?http://www.equifax.com/answers/set-fraud-alerts/en_efx">fraud alerts</a>).</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Place a security freeze on your credit files at each of the three Nationwide Credit Reporting Agencies.</strong>Â  You may request a security freeze be placed on your credit files at Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. You will have to contact each of them individually in order to place a security freeze on their credit file on you (see information about a <a href="https://www.myvalleybank.com/notice.htm?http://www.equifax.com/cs7/Satellite?c=EFX_Page_C&amp;childpagename=EFX%2FEFX_Page_C%2FGetcreditCP&amp;cid=1182374732430&amp;p=1182374732489&amp;packedargs=locale%3Den_efx&amp;pagename=EFX%2FWrapper">security freeze</a>).</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Block or close fraudulent accounts.</strong> Contact the appropriate creditors, banks, phone companies, and utility companies and have them close and discontinue reporting the accounts. You''ll probably be liable for only $50 of the fraudulent charges, but different issuers have different policies. Most creditors promptly issue replacement cards with new account numbers.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Mail fraud.</strong>Â  If you suspect that someone has changed your address with the post office or used the mail to commit identity theft, notify the US Postal Inspector.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Fraud using your Social Security number. </strong>If your Social Security number has been used to commit identity theft, contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which is charged with handling most identity theft complaints at 1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338). To order a copy of your Social Security Administration earnings and benefits statement to check whether someone has used your Social Security number to get a job or to avoid paying taxes visit <a href="https://www.myvalleybank.com/notice.htm?http://www.socialsecurity.gov/mystatement/">www.socialsecurity.gov/statement/</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Fraud involving your driver''s license number.</strong>Â  If your driver''s license number has been used to open accounts or verify checks, contact your state''s Department of Motor Vehicles.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Fraud involving your passport.</strong> Notify the <a href="https://www.myvalleybank.com/notice.htm?http://travel.state.gov/passport/passport_1738.html">U.S. State Department''s Passport Services Department</a> of the identity theft so that it can intercept anyone ordering a new passport in your name.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Fraud involving a business scam.</strong> If the fraud was perpetrated as part of a business scam, contact the National Fraud Information Center at 800-876-7060.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Bankruptcy filed using your name.Â </strong> If someone filed for bankruptcy using your name write to the U.S. Trustee in the region where the bankruptcy was filed. A listing of the U.S. Trustee Program''s Regions can be found at <a href="https://www.myvalleybank.com/notice.htm?http://www.usdoj.gov/ust/">www.usdoj.gov/ust</a>, or look in the blue pages of your phone book under US Government: Bankruptcy Administration.Â  Your letter should describe the situation and provide proof of your identity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Important Contact Information for Victims of Identity Theft?</h4>\r\nThere are a number of helpful services to help you respond if you have been a victim of identity theft.

Opening file attachments or clicking on Web links in suspicious eâmails could expose your\r\nsystem to malicious code that could hijack your computer.\r\nâ¢ Never respond to a suspicious eâmail or click on any hyperlink embedded in a suspicious eâmail:\r\nâ Call the purported source if you are unsure who sent the eâmail.\r\nâ If an eâmail claiming to be from your bank seems suspicious, checking with your financial institution.\r\nâ¢ Never provide sensitive or personal information in response to an eâmail message, even if it appears to be from your\r\nfinancial institution. If you are uncertain whether they have actually requested this information, contact them by\r\ntelephone.\r\nâ¢ Install a dedicated, actively managed firewall, especially if using a broadband or dedicated connection to the Internet, such\r\nas DSL or cable. A firewall limits the potential for unauthorized access to your network and computers.\r\nâ¢ Install antiâvirus and spyware detection software on all of your computer systems. Free software may not provide\r\nprotection against the latest threats compared with an industry standard product.\r\nâ¢ Check your settings and select at least a medium level of security for your browsers.\r\nâ¢ Ensure virus protection and security software are updated regularly.\r\nâ¢ Never share username and password information with thirdâparty providers.\r\nâ¢ Ensure computers are patched regularly, particularly operating systems and key applications, with security patches.\r\nâ¢ Do not use account numbers, social security number (SSN) or other account or personal information when creating\r\naccount nicknames or other titles.\r\nâ¢ Whenever possible, register your computer to avoid having to reâenter challenge questions and other authentication\r\ninformation with each login.\r\nâ¢ Do not open eâmail from unknown sources.\r\n\r\nTips for Wireless Network Management\r\nWireless networks can provide an unintended open door to your business network. Unless a valid business reason exists for\r\nwireless network use, it is recommended all wireless networks be disabled. If a wireless network is to be used for legitimate\r\nbusiness purposes, it is recommended wireless networks are secured as follows:\r\nâ¢ Change the wireless network hardware (router /access point) administrative password from the factory default to a\r\ncomplex password. Make certain to save the password in a secure location as it will be needed to make future changes to\r\nthe device.\r\nâ¢ Disable remote administration of the wireless network hardware (router/access point).\r\nâ¢ If possible, disable broadcasting the network service set identifier (SSID).\r\nâ¢ If your device offers WiâFi Protected Access (WPA) encryption, secure your wireless network by enabling WPA encryption\r\nof the wireless network. If your device does not support WPA encryption, enable Wired Equivalent Piracy (WEP)\r\nencryption.\r\n\r\nOnline Banking (OLB) Fraud Prevention\r\nBest Practices â For End Users\r\nâ¢ If only known computers will access the wireless network, consider enabling media access control (MAC) filtering on the\r\nnetwork hardware. Every computer network card is assigned a unique MAC address. MAC filtering only allows computers\r\nwith permitted MAC addresses access to the wireless network.\r\n\r\nFor OLB Cash Management Users\r\nGeneral Guidelines for Online Banking Activity\r\nâ¢ Clear the browser cache before starting an online banking session in order to eliminate copies of Web pages that have\r\nbeen stored on the hard drive. How the cache is cleared depends on the browser and version you are using. This\r\nfunction is generally found in the browser''s preferences menu.\r\nâ¢ Do not use public or other unsecured computers for logging into Online Banking.\r\nâ¢ Avoid using automatic login features that save usernames and passwords for online banking.\r\nâ¢ Never leave a computer unattended while using online banking.\r\nâ¢ Never conduct banking transactions while multiple browsers are open on your computer.\r\nâ¢ Create a strong password with at least eight characters that includes a combination of mixed case letters, numbers, and\r\nspecial characters.\r\nâ¢ Change your password frequently.\r\nâ¢ Always check the last login date/time every time you log in.\r\nâ¢ Review historical reporting features of your online banking application on a regular basis to confirm payment and other\r\ntransaction data.\r\nâ¢ Review account balances and transaction details regularly (preferable daily) and immediately report any suspicious\r\ntransactions to your Financial Institution.\r\nâ¢ Take advantage of automated alerts; examples include:\r\nâ Passwords are changed\r\nâ Eâmail addresses are changed\r\nâ Balance exceeds or drops below a certain level\r\nâ Weekly and daily available balance\r\nâ Monetary transactions such as fund transfers or stop payments are processed or cancelled\r\nâ¢ Whenever possible, use Bill Pay in lieu of checks to limit account number dissemination exposure and to obtain better\r\nelectronic record keeping.\r\n\r\nAdministrative Users\r\nâ¢ Limit administrative rights on users'' workstations to help prevent inadvertently downloading malware or other viruses.\r\n\r\nOnline Banking (OLB) Fraud Prevention\r\nBest Practices â For End Users\r\nâ¢ Dedicate and limit the number of computers used to complete online banking transactions; allow no Internet browsing\r\nor eâmail exchange and ensure these computers are equipped with the latest versions and patches of both antiâvirus and\r\nantiâspyware software.\r\nâ¢ Delete online user IDs as part of the exit procedure when employees leave the company.\r\nâ¢ Assign dual system administrators for online cash management services and require secondary approval for Automated\r\nClearing House (ACH) Batches and wire transfers.\r\nâ¢ Establish transaction dollar limits for employees who initiate and approve online payments.\r\nâ¢ Require additional Security Token entry for users responsible for monetary transactions such as account transfers, ACH\r\nbatch entries and approvals and wire transfer entries and approvals.\r\nâ¢ Manage access for each user only to the specific services that a user is required to access to do their job.\r\n\r\nTips to Protect Online Payments and Account Data\r\nâ¢ Take advantage of transaction limits. Establish limits for monetary transactions at multiple levels â per transaction, daily,\r\nweekly or monthly limits.\r\nâ¢ When you have completed a bank transaction, make certain to log off to break the connection with the bank''s computer.\r\nâ¢ Use separate accounts for electronic and paper transactions to simplify monitoring and tracking any discrepancies.\r\nâ¢ Reconcile by carefully monitoring account activity and reviewing all transactions initiated by your company on a daily\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\nACH Batches\r\nâ¢ Utilize preânotification transactions to verify account numbers within your ACH transactions are correct.\r\nâ¢ Utilize limits for monetary transactions at multiple levels â per batch, daily, weekly, or monthly limits.\r\nâ¢ Review transaction reporting regularly to confirm transaction activity.\r\nâ¢ Utilize available alerts for ACH activity.\r\nWire Transfer\r\nâ¢ Utilize limits provided for monetary transactions at multiple levels â per transaction, daily, weekly, or monthly limits.\r\nâ¢ Review historical and audit reports regularly to confirm transaction activity.\r\nâ¢ Utilize available alerts for wire transfer activity.\r\n\r\nAccount Transfer\r\nâ¢ Utilize limits provided monetary transactions at multiple levels â per transaction, daily, weekly or monthly limits.\r\nâ¢ Review historical and audit reports regularly to confirm transaction activity.\r\n\r\nOnline Banking (OLB) Fraud Prevention\r\nBest Practices â For End Users\r\nâ¢ Utilize available alerts for funds transfer activity.', 'OLB Retail Fraud Considerations', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'olb-retail-fraud-considerations', '', '', '2013-07-09 11:23:47', '2013-07-09 11:23:47', '', 0, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?page_id=251', 0, 'page', '', 0);

Do not share any confidential information through suspicious emails, websites, social\r\nmedia networks, text messages or phone calls.\r\n2. Protect your personal and account information, including your online banking username,\r\npassword, and answers to security questions. Do not write this information down or share\r\nit with anyone.\r\n3. Install, run, and keep anti-virus software updated.\r\nFraudulent emails (phishing)\r\nPhishing is usually a two-part scam involving emails and spoof websites. Fraudsters, also known\r\nas phishers, send an email to a wide audience that appears to come from a reputable company.\r\nThis is known as a phish email.\r\nIn the phish email, there are links to spoof websites that imitate a reputable companyâs website.\r\nFraudsters hope to convince victims to share their personal information by using clever and\r\ncompelling language, such as an urgent need for you to update your information immediately or\r\na need to communicate with you for your own safety or security. Once obtained, your personal\r\ninformation can be used to steal money or transfer stolen money into another account.\r\nUse caution if you receive an email expressing an urgent need for you to update your\r\ninformation, activate your online banking account, or verify your identity by clicking on a link.\r\nThese emails may be part of a phish scam conducted by fraudsters to capture your confidential\r\naccount information and commit fraud.\r\nHow fraudsters obtain email addresses\r\nFraudsters obtain email addresses from many places on the Internet. They also purchase email\r\nlists and sometimes guess email addresses. Fraudsters generally have no idea if people to whom\r\nthey send banking-related phish emails are actual bank customers. Their hope is that a\r\npercentage of those phish emails will be received by actual bank customers.\r\nIf you receive a fraudulent email that appears to come from Valley Bank, this does not mean that\r\nyour email address, name, or any other information has been taken from Valley Bankâs systems.\r\nFraudulent websites (phish or spoof websites)\r\nFraudsters may attempt to direct you to spoof websites via emails, pop-up windows or text\r\nmessages. These websites are used to try to obtain your personal information. One way to detect\r\na phony website is to consider how you got to the site. Use caution if you may have followed a\r\nlink in a suspicious email, text message, online chat or other pop-up window requesting your\r\npersonal or account information.\r\nVariations on phishing attacks\r\nPop-up windows\r\nFraudsters may use pop-up windows â small windows or ads â to obtain personal information.\r\nThese windows may be generated by programs hidden in free downloads such as screen savers\r\nor music-sharing software. To protect yourself from harmful pop-up windows, avoid\r\ndownloading programs from unknown sources on the Internet and always run anti-virus software\r\non your computer.\r\nTelephone or voice phishing\r\nKnown as vishing, or voice phishing, this tactic is a phishing attempt made through a telephone\r\ncall or voice message. Fraudsters may have the ability to spoof their caller ID so it could appear\r\nthat the telephone call is coming from a legitimate company. Fraudsters may also have\r\nidentifying customer information, such as your name, which they may use to make the call\r\nappear more authentic.\r\nIf you are uncomfortable with a phone call that was not initiated by you, hang up or ask for the\r\npurpose of the call. Then, contact the company using legitimate sources such as contact phone\r\nnumbers found on the companyâs website, your bank statements, and those listed on your ATM,\r\ndebit or credit card.\r\nText-message phishing\r\nA phishing attempt sent via SMS (Short Message Service) or text message to a mobile phone or\r\ndevice. This tactic is also referred to as smishing, which is a combination of SMS and phishing.\r\nThe purpose of text message phishing is the same as traditional email phishing: convince\r\nrecipients to share their sensitive or personal information.\r\nNever take action on a request for your personal or financial information, including account\r\nnumbers, passwords, Social Security number or birth date. Use caution if you receive a text\r\nmessage expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate an account, or\r\nverify your identity by calling a phone number or submitting information on a website. These\r\nmessages may be part of a phishing scam conducted by fraudsters in an attempt to capture your\r\nconfidential account information and may be used to commit fraud.\r\nPaper mail or fax phishing\r\nSome fraudsters still use low-tech methods to obtain your personal and financial information.\r\nPhishing attempts can be made through regular mail or fax machines. If you are suspicious about\r\na piece of mail or fax you have received requesting personal or financial information, you should\r\ndiscard it. If youâve responded to a mail or fax phish and provided personal or financial\r\ninformation, contact the company the mail or fax appears to be from. Use a legitimate source\r\nsuch as the phone number listed on the company''s website, billing statement, or on the back of\r\nyour ATM, debit or credit card to let the company know that your information was\r\ncompromised.\r\nReduce Your Risk\r\nReplace paper invoices, statements and checks with electronic versions.\r\nSign up at www.myvalleybank.com for free eStatements.\r\nSafety Tip\r\nNever open attachments, click on links, or respond to emails from suspicious or unknown\r\nsenders.\r\nLearn to Recognize Fraudulent Emails\r\nFraudulent emails (phish) and websites can be very sophisticated, and may look identical to\r\nValley Bankâs emails and websites. Fraudsters can even tamper with the sender information in\r\nan email to make their phish look even more legitimate. Although fraudsters use various tactics\r\nin their phish, there are common elements you should familiarize yourself with.\r\nDear valuedâ» VallyBank (s) member: â¶\r\nâºAs part of our security measures, we regularly screen activity in the Valley Bank Online Banking\r\nsystem.

Do not share any confidential information through suspicious emails, websites, social media networks, text messages or phone calls.\r\n2. Protect your personal and account information, including your online banking username, password, and answers to security questions. Do not write this information down or share it with anyone.\r\n3. Install, run, and keep anti-virus software updated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><strong>Fraudulent emails(phishing)</strong></h2>\r\nPhishing is usually a two-part scam involving emails and spoof websites. Fraudsters, also known as phishers, send an email to a wide audience that appears to come from a reputable company.\r\nThis is known as a phish email.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn the phish email, there are links to spoof websites that imitate a reputable companyâs website.\r\nFraudsters hope to convince victims to share their personal information by using clever and compelling language, such as an urgent need for you to update your information immediately or a need to communicate with you for your own safety or security. Once obtained, your personal\r\ninformation can be used to steal money or transfer stolen money into another account.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUse caution if you receive an email expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate your online banking account, or verify your identity by clicking on a link.\r\nThese emails may be part of a phish scam conducted by fraudsters to capture your confidential account information and commit fraud.\r\n<strong>How fraudsters obtain email addresses</strong>\r\n\r\nFraudsters obtain email addresses from many places on the Internet. They also purchase email\r\nlists and sometimes guess email addresses. Fraudsters generally have no idea if people to whom they send banking-related phish emails are actual bank customers. Their hope is that a percentage of those phish emails will be received by actual bank customers.\r\n\r\nIf you receive a fraudulent email that appears to come from your Bank, this does not mean that your email address, name, or any other information has been taken from your Bankâs systems.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><strong>Fraudulent websites (phish or spoof websites)</strong></h2>\r\nFraudsters may attempt to direct you to spoof websites via emails, pop-up windows or text messages. These websites are used to try to obtain your personal information. One way to detect\r\na phony website is to consider how you got to the site. Use caution if you may have followed a link in a suspicious email, text message, online chat or other pop-up window requesting your personal or account information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Variations on phishing attacks</span></strong></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Pop-up windows</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong></strong>Fraudsters may use pop-up windows â small windows or ads â to obtain personal information.\r\nThese windows may be generated by programs hidden in free downloads such as screen savers\r\nor music-sharing software. To protect yourself from harmful pop-up windows, avoid\r\ndownloading programs from unknown sources on the Internet and always run anti-virus software\r\non your computer.\r\n<strong>Telephone or voice phishing</strong>\r\nKnown as vishing, or voice phishing, this tactic is a phishing attempt made through a telephone\r\ncall or voice message. Fraudsters may have the ability to spoof their caller ID so it could appear\r\nthat the telephone call is coming from a legitimate company. Fraudsters may also have\r\nidentifying customer information, such as your name, which they may use to make the call\r\nappear more authentic.\r\nIf you are uncomfortable with a phone call that was not initiated by you, hang up or ask for the\r\npurpose of the call. Then, contact the company using legitimate sources such as contact phone\r\nnumbers found on the companyâs website, your bank statements, and those listed on your ATM,\r\ndebit or credit card.\r\n<strong>Text-message phishing</strong>\r\nA phishing attempt sent via SMS (Short Message Service) or text message to a mobile phone or\r\ndevice. This tactic is also referred to as smishing, which is a combination of SMS and phishing.\r\nThe purpose of text message phishing is the same as traditional email phishing: convince\r\nrecipients to share their sensitive or personal information.\r\nNever take action on a request for your personal or financial information, including account\r\nnumbers, passwords, Social Security number or birth date. Use caution if you receive a text\r\nmessage expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate an account, or\r\nverify your identity by calling a phone number or submitting information on a website. These\r\nmessages may be part of a phishing scam conducted by fraudsters in an attempt to capture your\r\nconfidential account information and may be used to commit fraud.\r\n<strong>Paper mail or fax phishing</strong>\r\nSome fraudsters still use low-tech methods to obtain your personal and financial information.\r\nPhishing attempts can be made through regular mail or fax machines. If you are suspicious about\r\na piece of mail or fax you have received requesting personal or financial information, you should\r\ndiscard it. If youâve responded to a mail or fax phish and provided personal or financial\r\ninformation, contact the company the mail or fax appears to be from. Use a legitimate source\r\nsuch as the phone number listed on the company''s website, billing statement, or on the back of\r\nyour ATM, debit or credit card to let the company know that your information was\r\ncompromised.\r\n<strong>Reduce Your Risk</strong>\r\nReplace paper invoices, statements and checks with electronic versions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Safety Tip</strong>\r\nNever open attachments, click on links, or respond to emails from suspicious or unknown\r\nsenders.\r\n<h2><strong>Learn to Recognize Fraudulent Emails</strong></h2>\r\nFraudulent emails (phish) and websites can be very sophisticated, and may look identical to\r\nyour Bankâs emails and websites. Fraudsters can even tamper with the sender information in\r\nan email to make their phish look even more legitimate. Although fraudsters use various tactics\r\nin their phish, there are common elements you should familiarize yourself with.\r\n<strong>1. Awkward greeting</strong>\r\nA phish may address the customer with a nonsensical greeting or may not refer to the customer\r\nby name.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Typos</strong>\r\nThis is not because fraudsters do not know how to spell â it is so the phish would not be blocked\r\nby email filters.\r\nExamples in this phish: âacessedâ âOur SSL security âseversâ has...â âfradulentâ\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Incorrect grammar</strong>\r\nAnother tactic used to bypass email filters.\r\nExamples in this phish: âOur SSL security severs has...â\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Strange or unfamiliar links</strong>\r\nThis link looks official, but what happens when the mouse cursor rolls over it. The linkâs source\r\ncode will point to a completely different web site. Remember that you can always type a URL\r\ninto your web browser instead of clicking on a link.\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Compelling or urgent language</strong>\r\nAn urgent need to communicate with you for your own security, or a request to update your\r\ninformation immediately.\r\nExamples in this phish: âWe recently contacted you after noticing an issue on your online\r\naccount, which has been acessed unusually.â\r\nâOur security department has requested information from you to verify your identity for your\r\nonline banking.â\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong> 6. Mis-spelled company name.</strong>\r\nAnother tactic used to bypass email filters.\r\nExample in the phish: âBank (s)â\r\nThis is not a comprehensive list of phish email characteristics, but these examples will help you\r\nlearn to recognize fraudulent emails.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Safety Tip</strong>\r\nNever open attachments, click on links, or respond to emails from suspicious or unknown\r\nsenders.', 'Fraudulent Emails, Websites and Phishing Variations', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'fraudulent-emails-websites-and-phishing-variations', '', '', '2013-07-20 09:21:36', '2013-07-20 09:21:36', '', 0, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?page_id=124', 0, 'page', '', 0),

Use caution if you receive a text\nmessage expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate an account, or\nverify your identity by calling a phone number or submitting information on a website.

If youâve responded to a mail or fax phish and provided personal or financial\ninformation, contact the company the mail or fax appears to be from.

Do not share any confidential information through suspicious emails, websites, social media networks, text messages or phone calls.\r\n2.

Install, run, and keep anti-virus software updated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Fraudulent emails(phishing)</strong>\r\n\r\nPhishing is usually a two-part scam involving emails and spoof websites. Fraudsters, also known as phishers, send an email to a wide audience that appears to come from a reputable company.\r\nThis is known as a phish email.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn the phish email, there are links to spoof websites that imitate a reputable companyâs website.\r\nFraudsters hope to convince victims to share their personal information by using clever and compelling language, such as an urgent need for you to update your information immediately or a need to communicate with you for your own safety or security. Once obtained, your personal\r\ninformation can be used to steal money or transfer stolen money into another account.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUse caution if you receive an email expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate your online banking account, or verify your identity by clicking on a link.\r\nThese emails may be part of a phish scam conducted by fraudsters to capture your confidential account information and commit fraud.\r\n<strong>How fraudsters obtain email addresses</strong>\r\n\r\nFraudsters obtain email addresses from many places on the Internet. They also purchase email\r\nlists and sometimes guess email addresses. Fraudsters generally have no idea if people to whom they send banking-related phish emails are actual bank customers. Their hope is that a percentage of those phish emails will be received by actual bank customers.\r\n\r\nIf you receive a fraudulent email that appears to come from Valley Bank, this does not mean that your email address, name, or any other information has been taken from Valley Bankâs systems.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Fraudulent websites (phish or spoof websites)</strong>\r\n\r\nFraudsters may attempt to direct you to spoof websites via emails, pop-up windows or text messages. These websites are used to try to obtain your personal information. One way to detect\r\na phony website is to consider how you got to the site. Use caution if you may have followed a link in a suspicious email, text message, online chat or other pop-up window requesting your personal or account information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Variations on phishing attacks</span></strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Pop-up windows</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong></strong>Fraudsters may use pop-up windows â small windows or ads â to obtain personal information.\r\nThese windows may be generated by programs hidden in free downloads such as screen savers\r\nor music-sharing software. To protect yourself from harmful pop-up windows, avoid\r\ndownloading programs from unknown sources on the Internet and always run anti-virus software\r\non your computer.\r\n<strong>Telephone or voice phishing</strong>\r\nKnown as vishing, or voice phishing, this tactic is a phishing attempt made through a telephone\r\ncall or voice message. Fraudsters may have the ability to spoof their caller ID so it could appear\r\nthat the telephone call is coming from a legitimate company. Fraudsters may also have\r\nidentifying customer information, such as your name, which they may use to make the call\r\nappear more authentic.\r\nIf you are uncomfortable with a phone call that was not initiated by you, hang up or ask for the\r\npurpose of the call. Then, contact the company using legitimate sources such as contact phone\r\nnumbers found on the companyâs website, your bank statements, and those listed on your ATM,\r\ndebit or credit card.\r\n<strong>Text-message phishing</strong>\r\nA phishing attempt sent via SMS (Short Message Service) or text message to a mobile phone or\r\ndevice. This tactic is also referred to as smishing, which is a combination of SMS and phishing.\r\nThe purpose of text message phishing is the same as traditional email phishing: convince\r\nrecipients to share their sensitive or personal information.\r\nNever take action on a request for your personal or financial information, including account\r\nnumbers, passwords, Social Security number or birth date. Use caution if you receive a text\r\nmessage expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate an account, or\r\nverify your identity by calling a phone number or submitting information on a website. These\r\nmessages may be part of a phishing scam conducted by fraudsters in an attempt to capture your\r\nconfidential account information and may be used to commit fraud.\r\n<strong>Paper mail or fax phishing</strong>\r\nSome fraudsters still use low-tech methods to obtain your personal and financial information.\r\nPhishing attempts can be made through regular mail or fax machines. If you are suspicious about\r\na piece of mail or fax you have received requesting personal or financial information, you should\r\ndiscard it. If youâve responded to a mail or fax phish and provided personal or financial\r\ninformation, contact the company the mail or fax appears to be from. Use a legitimate source\r\nsuch as the phone number listed on the company''s website, billing statement, or on the back of\r\nyour ATM, debit or credit card to let the company know that your information was\r\ncompromised.\r\n<strong>Reduce Your Risk</strong>\r\nReplace paper invoices, statements and checks with electronic versions.\r\nSign up at www.myvalleybank.com for free eStatements.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Safety Tip</strong>\r\nNever open attachments, click on links, or respond to emails from suspicious or unknown\r\nsenders.\r\n<strong>Learn to Recognize Fraudulent Emails</strong>\r\nFraudulent emails (phish) and websites can be very sophisticated, and may look identical to\r\nValley Bankâs emails and websites. Fraudsters can even tamper with the sender information in\r\nan email to make their phish look even more legitimate. Although fraudsters use various tactics\r\nin their phish, there are common elements you should familiarize yourself with.\r\n\r\nThank You!\r\n<strong>1.

Fraudsters, also known\r\nas phishers, send an email to a wide audience that appears to come from a reputable company.\r\nThis is known as a phish email.\r\nIn the phish email, there are links to spoof websites that imitate a reputable companyâs website.\r\nFraudsters hope to convince victims to share their personal information by using clever and\r\ncompelling language, such as an urgent need for you to update your information immediately or\r\na need to communicate with you for your own safety or security. Once obtained, your personal\r\ninformation can be used to steal money or transfer stolen money into another account.\r\nUse caution if you receive an email expressing an urgent need for you to update your\r\ninformation, activate your online banking account, or verify your identity by clicking on a link.\r\nThese emails may be part of a phish scam conducted by fraudsters to capture your confidential\r\naccount information and commit fraud.\r\nHow fraudsters obtain email addresses\r\nFraudsters obtain email addresses from many places on the Internet. They also purchase email\r\nlists and sometimes guess email addresses. Fraudsters generally have no idea if people to whom\r\nthey send banking-related phish emails are actual bank customers. Their hope is that a\r\npercentage of those phish emails will be received by actual bank customers.\r\nIf you receive a fraudulent email that appears to come from Valley Bank, this does not mean that\r\nyour email address, name, or any other information has been taken from Valley Bankâs systems.\r\nFraudulent websites (phish or spoof websites)\r\nFraudsters may attempt to direct you to spoof websites via emails, pop-up windows or text\r\nmessages. These websites are used to try to obtain your personal information. One way to detect\r\na phony website is to consider how you got to the site. Use caution if you may have followed a\r\nlink in a suspicious email, text message, online chat or other pop-up window requesting your\r\npersonal or account information.\r\nVariations on phishing attacks\r\nPop-up windows\r\nFraudsters may use pop-up windows â small windows or ads â to obtain personal information.\r\nThese windows may be generated by programs hidden in free downloads such as screen savers\r\nor music-sharing software. To protect yourself from harmful pop-up windows, avoid\r\ndownloading programs from unknown sources on the Internet and always run anti-virus software\r\non your computer.\r\nTelephone or voice phishing\r\nKnown as vishing, or voice phishing, this tactic is a phishing attempt made through a telephone\r\ncall or voice message. Fraudsters may have the ability to spoof their caller ID so it could appear\r\nthat the telephone call is coming from a legitimate company. Fraudsters may also have\r\nidentifying customer information, such as your name, which they may use to make the call\r\nappear more authentic.\r\nIf you are uncomfortable with a phone call that was not initiated by you, hang up or ask for the\r\npurpose of the call. Then, contact the company using legitimate sources such as contact phone\r\nnumbers found on the companyâs website, your bank statements, and those listed on your ATM,\r\ndebit or credit card.\r\nText-message phishing\r\nA phishing attempt sent via SMS (Short Message Service) or text message to a mobile phone or\r\ndevice. This tactic is also referred to as smishing, which is a combination of SMS and phishing.\r\nThe purpose of text message phishing is the same as traditional email phishing: convince\r\nrecipients to share their sensitive or personal information.\r\nNever take action on a request for your personal or financial information, including account\r\nnumbers, passwords, Social Security number or birth date. Use caution if you receive a text\r\nmessage expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate an account, or\r\nverify your identity by calling a phone number or submitting information on a website. These\r\nmessages may be part of a phishing scam conducted by fraudsters in an attempt to capture your\r\nconfidential account information and may be used to commit fraud.\r\nPaper mail or fax phishing\r\nSome fraudsters still use low-tech methods to obtain your personal and financial information.\r\nPhishing attempts can be made through regular mail or fax machines. If you are suspicious about\r\na piece of mail or fax you have received requesting personal or financial information, you should\r\ndiscard it. If youâve responded to a mail or fax phish and provided personal or financial\r\ninformation, contact the company the mail or fax appears to be from. Use a legitimate source\r\nsuch as the phone number listed on the company''s website, billing statement, or on the back of\r\nyour ATM, debit or credit card to let the company know that your information was\r\ncompromised.\r\nReduce Your Risk\r\nReplace paper invoices, statements and checks with electronic versions.\r\nSign up at www.myvalleybank.com for free eStatements.\r\nSafety Tip\r\nNever open attachments, click on links, or respond to emails from suspicious or unknown\r\nsenders.\r\nLearn to Recognize Fraudulent Emails\r\nFraudulent emails (phish) and websites can be very sophisticated, and may look identical to\r\nValley Bankâs emails and websites. Fraudsters can even tamper with the sender information in\r\nan email to make their phish look even more legitimate.

Install, run, and keep anti-virus software updated.\r\n\r\n<strong>Fraudulent emails</strong>(phishing) Phishing is usually a two-part scam involving emails and spoof websites. Fraudsters, also known as phishers, send an email to a wide audience that appears to come from a reputable company.\r\nThis is known as a phish email. In the phish email, there are links to spoof websites that imitate a reputable companyâs website.\r\nFraudsters hope to convince victims to share their personal information by using clever and compelling language, such as an urgent need for you to update your information immediately or a need to communicate with you for your own safety or security. Once obtained, your personal\r\ninformation can be used to steal money or transfer stolen money into another account. Use caution if you receive an email expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate your online banking account, or verify your identity by clicking on a link.\r\nThese emails may be part of a phish scam conducted by fraudsters to capture your confidential account information and commit fraud.\r\nHow fraudsters obtain email addresses Fraudsters obtain email addresses from many places on the Internet. They also purchase email\r\nlists and sometimes guess email addresses. Fraudsters generally have no idea if people to whom they send banking-related phish emails are actual bank customers. Their hope is that a percentage of those phish emails will be received by actual bank customers.\r\nIf you receive a fraudulent email that appears to come from Valley Bank, this does not mean that your email address, name, or any other information has been taken from Valley Bankâs systems. Fraudulent websites (phish or spoof websites) Fraudsters may attempt to direct you to spoof websites via emails, pop-up windows or text messages. These websites are used to try to obtain your personal information. One way to detect\r\na phony website is to consider how you got to the site. Use caution if you may have followed a link in a suspicious email, text message, online chat or other pop-up window requesting your personal or account information. Variations on phishing attacks Pop-up windows Fraudsters may use pop-up windows â small windows or ads â to obtain personal information.\r\nThese windows may be generated by programs hidden in free downloads such as screen savers\r\nor music-sharing software. To protect yourself from harmful pop-up windows, avoid\r\ndownloading programs from unknown sources on the Internet and always run anti-virus software\r\non your computer.\r\nTelephone or voice phishing\r\nKnown as vishing, or voice phishing, this tactic is a phishing attempt made through a telephone\r\ncall or voice message. Fraudsters may have the ability to spoof their caller ID so it could appear\r\nthat the telephone call is coming from a legitimate company. Fraudsters may also have\r\nidentifying customer information, such as your name, which they may use to make the call\r\nappear more authentic.\r\nIf you are uncomfortable with a phone call that was not initiated by you, hang up or ask for the\r\npurpose of the call. Then, contact the company using legitimate sources such as contact phone\r\nnumbers found on the companyâs website, your bank statements, and those listed on your ATM,\r\ndebit or credit card.\r\nText-message phishing\r\nA phishing attempt sent via SMS (Short Message Service) or text message to a mobile phone or\r\ndevice. This tactic is also referred to as smishing, which is a combination of SMS and phishing.\r\nThe purpose of text message phishing is the same as traditional email phishing: convince\r\nrecipients to share their sensitive or personal information.\r\nNever take action on a request for your personal or financial information, including account\r\nnumbers, passwords, Social Security number or birth date. Use caution if you receive a text\r\nmessage expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate an account, or\r\nverify your identity by calling a phone number or submitting information on a website. These\r\nmessages may be part of a phishing scam conducted by fraudsters in an attempt to capture your\r\nconfidential account information and may be used to commit fraud.\r\nPaper mail or fax phishing\r\nSome fraudsters still use low-tech methods to obtain your personal and financial information.\r\nPhishing attempts can be made through regular mail or fax machines. If you are suspicious about\r\na piece of mail or fax you have received requesting personal or financial information, you should\r\ndiscard it. If youâve responded to a mail or fax phish and provided personal or financial\r\ninformation, contact the company the mail or fax appears to be from. Use a legitimate source\r\nsuch as the phone number listed on the company''s website, billing statement, or on the back of\r\nyour ATM, debit or credit card to let the company know that your information was\r\ncompromised.\r\nReduce Your Risk\r\nReplace paper invoices, statements and checks with electronic versions.\r\nSign up at www.myvalleybank.com for free eStatements.\r\nSafety Tip\r\nNever open attachments, click on links, or respond to emails from suspicious or unknown\r\nsenders.\r\nLearn to Recognize Fraudulent Emails\r\nFraudulent emails (phish) and websites can be very sophisticated, and may look identical to\r\nValley Bankâs emails and websites.

Install, run, and keep anti-virus software updated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Fraudulent emails(phishing)</strong>\r\n\r\nPhishing is usually a two-part scam involving emails and spoof websites. Fraudsters, also known as phishers, send an email to a wide audience that appears to come from a reputable company.\r\nThis is known as a phish email.\r\n\r\nIn the phish email, there are links to spoof websites that imitate a reputable companyâs website.\r\nFraudsters hope to convince victims to share their personal information by using clever and compelling language, such as an urgent need for you to update your information immediately or a need to communicate with you for your own safety or security. Once obtained, your personal\r\ninformation can be used to steal money or transfer stolen money into another account. Use caution if you receive an email expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate your online banking account, or verify your identity by clicking on a link.\r\nThese emails may be part of a phish scam conducted by fraudsters to capture your confidential account information and commit fraud.\r\nHow fraudsters obtain email addresses Fraudsters obtain email addresses from many places on the Internet. They also purchase email\r\nlists and sometimes guess email addresses. Fraudsters generally have no idea if people to whom they send banking-related phish emails are actual bank customers. Their hope is that a percentage of those phish emails will be received by actual bank customers.\r\nIf you receive a fraudulent email that appears to come from Valley Bank, this does not mean that your email address, name, or any other information has been taken from Valley Bankâs systems. Fraudulent websites (phish or spoof websites) Fraudsters may attempt to direct you to spoof websites via emails, pop-up windows or text messages. These websites are used to try to obtain your personal information. One way to detect\r\na phony website is to consider how you got to the site. Use caution if you may have followed a link in a suspicious email, text message, online chat or other pop-up window requesting your personal or account information. Variations on phishing attacks Pop-up windows Fraudsters may use pop-up windows â small windows or ads â to obtain personal information.\r\nThese windows may be generated by programs hidden in free downloads such as screen savers\r\nor music-sharing software. To protect yourself from harmful pop-up windows, avoid\r\ndownloading programs from unknown sources on the Internet and always run anti-virus software\r\non your computer.\r\nTelephone or voice phishing\r\nKnown as vishing, or voice phishing, this tactic is a phishing attempt made through a telephone\r\ncall or voice message. Fraudsters may have the ability to spoof their caller ID so it could appear\r\nthat the telephone call is coming from a legitimate company. Fraudsters may also have\r\nidentifying customer information, such as your name, which they may use to make the call\r\nappear more authentic.\r\nIf you are uncomfortable with a phone call that was not initiated by you, hang up or ask for the\r\npurpose of the call. Then, contact the company using legitimate sources such as contact phone\r\nnumbers found on the companyâs website, your bank statements, and those listed on your ATM,\r\ndebit or credit card.\r\nText-message phishing\r\nA phishing attempt sent via SMS (Short Message Service) or text message to a mobile phone or\r\ndevice. This tactic is also referred to as smishing, which is a combination of SMS and phishing.\r\nThe purpose of text message phishing is the same as traditional email phishing: convince\r\nrecipients to share their sensitive or personal information.\r\nNever take action on a request for your personal or financial information, including account\r\nnumbers, passwords, Social Security number or birth date. Use caution if you receive a text\r\nmessage expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate an account, or\r\nverify your identity by calling a phone number or submitting information on a website. These\r\nmessages may be part of a phishing scam conducted by fraudsters in an attempt to capture your\r\nconfidential account information and may be used to commit fraud.\r\nPaper mail or fax phishing\r\nSome fraudsters still use low-tech methods to obtain your personal and financial information.\r\nPhishing attempts can be made through regular mail or fax machines. If you are suspicious about\r\na piece of mail or fax you have received requesting personal or financial information, you should\r\ndiscard it. If youâve responded to a mail or fax phish and provided personal or financial\r\ninformation, contact the company the mail or fax appears to be from. Use a legitimate source\r\nsuch as the phone number listed on the company''s website, billing statement, or on the back of\r\nyour ATM, debit or credit card to let the company know that your information was\r\ncompromised.\r\nReduce Your Risk\r\nReplace paper invoices, statements and checks with electronic versions.\r\nSign up at www.myvalleybank.com for free eStatements.\r\nSafety Tip\r\nNever open attachments, click on links, or respond to emails from suspicious or unknown\r\nsenders.\r\nLearn to Recognize Fraudulent Emails\r\nFraudulent emails (phish) and websites can be very sophisticated, and may look identical to\r\nValley Bankâs emails and websites. Fraudsters can even tamper with the sender information in\r\nan email to make their phish look even more legitimate. Although fraudsters use various tactics\r\nin their phish, there are common elements you should familiarize yourself with.\r\nDear valuedâ» VallyBank (s) member: â¶\r\nâºAs part of our security measures, we regularly screen activity in the Valley Bank Online Banking\r\nsystem.

From a legal and compliance perspective, an information security policy is often viewed as a commitment from senior management to protect information. A documented policy is frequently a requirement to satisfy regulations or laws, such as those relating to privacy and finance.

Do not share any confidential information through suspicious emails, websites, social media networks, text messages or phone calls.\r\n2. Protect your personal and account information, including your online banking username, password, and answers to security questions. Do not write this information down or share it with anyone.\r\n3. Install, run, and keep anti-virus software updated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Fraudulent emails(phishing)</strong>\r\n\r\nPhishing is usually a two-part scam involving emails and spoof websites. Fraudsters, also known as phishers, send an email to a wide audience that appears to come from a reputable company.\r\nThis is known as a phish email.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn the phish email, there are links to spoof websites that imitate a reputable companyâs website.\r\nFraudsters hope to convince victims to share their personal information by using clever and compelling language, such as an urgent need for you to update your information immediately or a need to communicate with you for your own safety or security. Once obtained, your personal\r\ninformation can be used to steal money or transfer stolen money into another account.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUse caution if you receive an email expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate your online banking account, or verify your identity by clicking on a link.\r\nThese emails may be part of a phish scam conducted by fraudsters to capture your confidential account information and commit fraud.\r\n<strong>How fraudsters obtain email addresses</strong>\r\n\r\nFraudsters obtain email addresses from many places on the Internet. They also purchase email\r\nlists and sometimes guess email addresses. Fraudsters generally have no idea if people to whom they send banking-related phish emails are actual bank customers. Their hope is that a percentage of those phish emails will be received by actual bank customers.\r\n\r\nIf you receive a fraudulent email that appears to come from Valley Bank, this does not mean that your email address, name, or any other information has been taken from Valley Bankâs systems.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Fraudulent websites (phish or spoof websites)</strong>\r\n\r\nFraudsters may attempt to direct you to spoof websites via emails, pop-up windows or text messages. These websites are used to try to obtain your personal information. One way to detect\r\na phony website is to consider how you got to the site. Use caution if you may have followed a link in a suspicious email, text message, online chat or other pop-up window requesting your personal or account information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Variations on phishing attacks</span></strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Pop-up windows</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong></strong>Fraudsters may use pop-up windows â small windows or ads â to obtain personal information.\r\nThese windows may be generated by programs hidden in free downloads such as screen savers\r\nor music-sharing software. To protect yourself from harmful pop-up windows, avoid\r\ndownloading programs from unknown sources on the Internet and always run anti-virus software\r\non your computer.\r\n<strong>Telephone or voice phishing</strong>\r\nKnown as vishing, or voice phishing, this tactic is a phishing attempt made through a telephone\r\ncall or voice message. Fraudsters may have the ability to spoof their caller ID so it could appear\r\nthat the telephone call is coming from a legitimate company. Fraudsters may also have\r\nidentifying customer information, such as your name, which they may use to make the call\r\nappear more authentic.\r\nIf you are uncomfortable with a phone call that was not initiated by you, hang up or ask for the\r\npurpose of the call. Then, contact the company using legitimate sources such as contact phone\r\nnumbers found on the companyâs website, your bank statements, and those listed on your ATM,\r\ndebit or credit card.\r\n<strong>Text-message phishing</strong>\r\nA phishing attempt sent via SMS (Short Message Service) or text message to a mobile phone or\r\ndevice. This tactic is also referred to as smishing, which is a combination of SMS and phishing.\r\nThe purpose of text message phishing is the same as traditional email phishing: convince\r\nrecipients to share their sensitive or personal information.\r\nNever take action on a request for your personal or financial information, including account\r\nnumbers, passwords, Social Security number or birth date. Use caution if you receive a text\r\nmessage expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate an account, or\r\nverify your identity by calling a phone number or submitting information on a website. These\r\nmessages may be part of a phishing scam conducted by fraudsters in an attempt to capture your\r\nconfidential account information and may be used to commit fraud.\r\n<strong>Paper mail or fax phishing</strong>\r\nSome fraudsters still use low-tech methods to obtain your personal and financial information.\r\nPhishing attempts can be made through regular mail or fax machines. If you are suspicious about\r\na piece of mail or fax you have received requesting personal or financial information, you should\r\ndiscard it. If youâve responded to a mail or fax phish and provided personal or financial\r\ninformation, contact the company the mail or fax appears to be from. Use a legitimate source\r\nsuch as the phone number listed on the company''s website, billing statement, or on the back of\r\nyour ATM, debit or credit card to let the company know that your information was\r\ncompromised.\r\n<strong>Reduce Your Risk</strong>\r\nReplace paper invoices, statements and checks with electronic versions.\r\nSign up at www.myvalleybank.com for free eStatements.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Safety Tip</strong>\r\nNever open attachments, click on links, or respond to emails from suspicious or unknown\r\nsenders.\r\n<strong>Learn to Recognize Fraudulent Emails</strong>\r\nFraudulent emails (phish) and websites can be very sophisticated, and may look identical to\r\nValley Bankâs emails and websites. Fraudsters can even tamper with the sender information in\r\nan email to make their phish look even more legitimate. Although fraudsters use various tactics\r\nin their phish, there are common elements you should familiarize yourself with.\r\n\r\nThank You!\r\n<strong>1. Awkward greeting</strong>\r\nA phish may address the customer with a nonsensical greeting or may not refer to the customer\r\nby name.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Typos</strong>\r\nThis is not because fraudsters do not know how to spell â it is so the phish would not be blocked\r\nby email filters.\r\nExamples in this phish: âacessedâ âOur SSL security âseversâ has...â âfradulentâ\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Incorrect grammar</strong>\r\nAnother tactic used to bypass email filters.\r\nExamples in this phish: âOur SSL security severs has...â\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Strange or unfamiliar links</strong>\r\nThis link looks official, but what happens when the mouse cursor rolls over it. The linkâs source\r\ncode will point to a completely different web site. Remember that you can always type a URL\r\ninto your web browser instead of clicking on a link.\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Compelling or urgent language</strong>\r\nAn urgent need to communicate with you for your own security, or a request to update your\r\ninformation immediately.\r\nExamples in this phish: âWe recently contacted you after noticing an issue on your online\r\naccount, which has been acessed unusually.â\r\nâOur security department has requested information from you to verify your identity for your\r\nonline banking.â\r\n<strong> 6. Mis-spelled company name.</strong>\r\nAnother tactic used to bypass email filters.\r\nExample in the phish: âVallyBank (s)â\r\nThis is not a comprehensive list of phish email characteristics, but these examples will help you\r\nlearn to recognize fraudulent emails.\r\nValley Bank is dedicated to protecting your information. Learn about our security measures and\r\nwhat we do to protect your accounts online.\r\nReport Phish and Email Scams\r\nSend Valley Bank phish emails and fraudulent websites to:\r\ncustomerservice@myvalleybank.com\r\nIf you provided personal or account information through an email or suspicious website, contact:\r\n1-540-342-2265.\r\nSafety Tip\r\nNever open attachments, click on links, or respond to emails from suspicious or unknown\r\nsenders.', 'Fraudulent Emails, Websites and Phishing Variations', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '124-revision-11', '', '', '2013-07-02 17:51:50', '2013-07-02 17:51:50', '', 124, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?p=267', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Do not share any confidential information through suspicious emails, websites, social media networks, text messages or phone calls.\r\n2. Protect your personal and account information, including your online banking username, password, and answers to security questions. Do not write this information down or share it with anyone.\r\n3. Install, run, and keep anti-virus software updated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Fraudulent emails(phishing)</strong>\r\n\r\nPhishing is usually a two-part scam involving emails and spoof websites. Fraudsters, also known as phishers, send an email to a wide audience that appears to come from a reputable company.\r\nThis is known as a phish email.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn the phish email, there are links to spoof websites that imitate a reputable companyâs website.\r\nFraudsters hope to convince victims to share their personal information by using clever and compelling language, such as an urgent need for you to update your information immediately or a need to communicate with you for your own safety or security. Once obtained, your personal\r\ninformation can be used to steal money or transfer stolen money into another account.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUse caution if you receive an email expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate your online banking account, or verify your identity by clicking on a link.\r\nThese emails may be part of a phish scam conducted by fraudsters to capture your confidential account information and commit fraud.\r\n<strong>How fraudsters obtain email addresses</strong>\r\n\r\nFraudsters obtain email addresses from many places on the Internet. They also purchase email\r\nlists and sometimes guess email addresses. Fraudsters generally have no idea if people to whom they send banking-related phish emails are actual bank customers. Their hope is that a percentage of those phish emails will be received by actual bank customers.\r\n\r\nIf you receive a fraudulent email that appears to come from Valley Bank, this does not mean that your email address, name, or any other information has been taken from Valley Bankâs systems.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Fraudulent websites (phish or spoof websites)</strong>\r\n\r\nFraudsters may attempt to direct you to spoof websites via emails, pop-up windows or text messages. These websites are used to try to obtain your personal information. One way to detect\r\na phony website is to consider how you got to the site. Use caution if you may have followed a link in a suspicious email, text message, online chat or other pop-up window requesting your personal or account information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Variations on phishing attacks</span></strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Pop-up windows</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong></strong>Fraudsters may use pop-up windows â small windows or ads â to obtain personal information.\r\nThese windows may be generated by programs hidden in free downloads such as screen savers\r\nor music-sharing software. To protect yourself from harmful pop-up windows, avoid\r\ndownloading programs from unknown sources on the Internet and always run anti-virus software\r\non your computer.\r\n<strong>Telephone or voice phishing</strong>\r\nKnown as vishing, or voice phishing, this tactic is a phishing attempt made through a telephone\r\ncall or voice message. Fraudsters may have the ability to spoof their caller ID so it could appear\r\nthat the telephone call is coming from a legitimate company. Fraudsters may also have\r\nidentifying customer information, such as your name, which they may use to make the call\r\nappear more authentic.\r\nIf you are uncomfortable with a phone call that was not initiated by you, hang up or ask for the\r\npurpose of the call. Then, contact the company using legitimate sources such as contact phone\r\nnumbers found on the companyâs website, your bank statements, and those listed on your ATM,\r\ndebit or credit card.\r\n<strong>Text-message phishing</strong>\r\nA phishing attempt sent via SMS (Short Message Service) or text message to a mobile phone or\r\ndevice.

This tactic is also referred to as smishing, which is a combination of SMS and phishing.\r\nThe purpose of text message phishing is the same as traditional email phishing: convince\r\nrecipients to share their sensitive or personal information.\r\nNever take action on a request for your personal or financial information, including account\r\nnumbers, passwords, Social Security number or birth date.

Their hope is that a percentage of those phish emails will be received by actual bank customers.\r\n\r\nIf you receive a fraudulent email that appears to come from Valley Bank, this does not mean that your email address, name, or any other information has been taken from Valley Bankâs systems.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Fraudulent websites (phish or spoof websites)</strong>\r\n\r\nFraudsters may attempt to direct you to spoof websites via emails, pop-up windows or text messages. These websites are used to try to obtain your personal information. One way to detect\r\na phony website is to consider how you got to the site. Use caution if you may have followed a link in a suspicious email, text message, online chat or other pop-up window requesting your personal or account information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Variations on phishing attacks</span></strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Pop-up windows</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong></strong>Fraudsters may use pop-up windows â small windows or ads â to obtain personal information.\r\nThese windows may be generated by programs hidden in free downloads such as screen savers\r\nor music-sharing software. To protect yourself from harmful pop-up windows, avoid\r\ndownloading programs from unknown sources on the Internet and always run anti-virus software\r\non your computer.\r\n<strong>Telephone or voice phishing</strong>\r\nKnown as vishing, or voice phishing, this tactic is a phishing attempt made through a telephone\r\ncall or voice message. Fraudsters may have the ability to spoof their caller ID so it could appear\r\nthat the telephone call is coming from a legitimate company. Fraudsters may also have\r\nidentifying customer information, such as your name, which they may use to make the call\r\nappear more authentic.\r\nIf you are uncomfortable with a phone call that was not initiated by you, hang up or ask for the\r\npurpose of the call. Then, contact the company using legitimate sources such as contact phone\r\nnumbers found on the companyâs website, your bank statements, and those listed on your ATM,\r\ndebit or credit card.\r\n<strong>Text-message phishing</strong>\r\nA phishing attempt sent via SMS (Short Message Service) or text message to a mobile phone or\r\ndevice. This tactic is also referred to as smishing, which is a combination of SMS and phishing.\r\nThe purpose of text message phishing is the same as traditional email phishing: convince\r\nrecipients to share their sensitive or personal information.\r\nNever take action on a request for your personal or financial information, including account\r\nnumbers, passwords, Social Security number or birth date. Use caution if you receive a text\r\nmessage expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate an account, or\r\nverify your identity by calling a phone number or submitting information on a website. These\r\nmessages may be part of a phishing scam conducted by fraudsters in an attempt to capture your\r\nconfidential account information and may be used to commit fraud.\r\n<strong>Paper mail or fax phishing</strong>\r\nSome fraudsters still use low-tech methods to obtain your personal and financial information.\r\nPhishing attempts can be made through regular mail or fax machines. If you are suspicious about\r\na piece of mail or fax you have received requesting personal or financial information, you should\r\ndiscard it. If youâve responded to a mail or fax phish and provided personal or financial\r\ninformation, contact the company the mail or fax appears to be from. Use a legitimate source\r\nsuch as the phone number listed on the company''s website, billing statement, or on the back of\r\nyour ATM, debit or credit card to let the company know that your information was\r\ncompromised.\r\n<strong>Reduce Your Risk</strong>\r\nReplace paper invoices, statements and checks with electronic versions.\r\nSign up at www.myvalleybank.com for free eStatements.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Safety Tip</strong>\r\nNever open attachments, click on links, or respond to emails from suspicious or unknown\r\nsenders.\r\n<strong>Learn to Recognize Fraudulent Emails</strong>\r\nFraudulent emails (phish) and websites can be very sophisticated, and may look identical to\r\nValley Bankâs emails and websites. Fraudsters can even tamper with the sender information in\r\nan email to make their phish look even more legitimate. Although fraudsters use various tactics\r\nin their phish, there are common elements you should familiarize yourself with.\r\n\r\nThank You!\r\n<strong>1. Awkward greeting</strong>\r\nA phish may address the customer with a nonsensical greeting or may not refer to the customer\r\nby name.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Typos</strong>\r\nThis is not because fraudsters do not know how to spell â it is so the phish would not be blocked\r\nby email filters.\r\nExamples in this phish: âacessedâ âOur SSL security âseversâ has...â âfradulentâ\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Incorrect grammar</strong>\r\nAnother tactic used to bypass email filters.\r\nExamples in this phish: âOur SSL security severs has...â\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Strange or unfamiliar links</strong>\r\nThis link looks official, but what happens when the mouse cursor rolls over it. The linkâs source\r\ncode will point to a completely different web site. Remember that you can always type a URL\r\ninto your web browser instead of clicking on a link.\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Compelling or urgent language</strong>\r\nAn urgent need to communicate with you for your own security, or a request to update your\r\ninformation immediately.\r\nExamples in this phish: âWe recently contacted you after noticing an issue on your online\r\naccount, which has been acessed unusually.â\r\nâOur security department has requested information from you to verify your identity for your\r\nonline banking.â\r\n<strong> 6. Mis-spelled company name.</strong>\r\nAnother tactic used to bypass email filters.\r\nExample in the phish: âVallyBank (s)â\r\nThis is not a comprehensive list of phish email characteristics, but these examples will help you\r\nlearn to recognize fraudulent emails.\r\nValley Bank is dedicated to protecting your information.

Do not share any confidential information through suspicious emails, websites, social media networks, text messages or phone calls.\r\n2. Protect your personal and account information, including your online banking username, password, and answers to security questions. Do not write this information down or share it with anyone.\r\n3. Install, run, and keep anti-virus software updated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Fraudulent emails(phishing)</strong>\r\n\r\nPhishing is usually a two-part scam involving emails and spoof websites. Fraudsters, also known as phishers, send an email to a wide audience that appears to come from a reputable company.\r\nThis is known as a phish email.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn the phish email, there are links to spoof websites that imitate a reputable companyâs website.\r\nFraudsters hope to convince victims to share their personal information by using clever and compelling language, such as an urgent need for you to update your information immediately or a need to communicate with you for your own safety or security. Once obtained, your personal\r\ninformation can be used to steal money or transfer stolen money into another account.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUse caution if you receive an email expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate your online banking account, or verify your identity by clicking on a link.\r\nThese emails may be part of a phish scam conducted by fraudsters to capture your confidential account information and commit fraud.\r\n<strong>How fraudsters obtain email addresses</strong>\r\n\r\nFraudsters obtain email addresses from many places on the Internet. They also purchase email\r\nlists and sometimes guess email addresses. Fraudsters generally have no idea if people to whom they send banking-related phish emails are actual bank customers. Their hope is that a percentage of those phish emails will be received by actual bank customers.\r\n\r\nIf you receive a fraudulent email that appears to come from your Bank, this does not mean that your email address, name, or any other information has been taken from your Bankâs systems.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Fraudulent websites (phish or spoof websites)</strong>\r\n\r\nFraudsters may attempt to direct you to spoof websites via emails, pop-up windows or text messages. These websites are used to try to obtain your personal information. One way to detect\r\na phony website is to consider how you got to the site. Use caution if you may have followed a link in a suspicious email, text message, online chat or other pop-up window requesting your personal or account information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Variations on phishing attacks</span></strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Pop-up windows</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong></strong>Fraudsters may use pop-up windows â small windows or ads â to obtain personal information.\r\nThese windows may be generated by programs hidden in free downloads such as screen savers\r\nor music-sharing software. To protect yourself from harmful pop-up windows, avoid\r\ndownloading programs from unknown sources on the Internet and always run anti-virus software\r\non your computer.\r\n<strong>Telephone or voice phishing</strong>\r\nKnown as vishing, or voice phishing, this tactic is a phishing attempt made through a telephone\r\ncall or voice message. Fraudsters may have the ability to spoof their caller ID so it could appear\r\nthat the telephone call is coming from a legitimate company. Fraudsters may also have\r\nidentifying customer information, such as your name, which they may use to make the call\r\nappear more authentic.\r\nIf you are uncomfortable with a phone call that was not initiated by you, hang up or ask for the\r\npurpose of the call. Then, contact the company using legitimate sources such as contact phone\r\nnumbers found on the companyâs website, your bank statements, and those listed on your ATM,\r\ndebit or credit card.\r\n<strong>Text-message phishing</strong>\r\nA phishing attempt sent via SMS (Short Message Service) or text message to a mobile phone or\r\ndevice. This tactic is also referred to as smishing, which is a combination of SMS and phishing.\r\nThe purpose of text message phishing is the same as traditional email phishing: convince\r\nrecipients to share their sensitive or personal information.\r\nNever take action on a request for your personal or financial information, including account\r\nnumbers, passwords, Social Security number or birth date. Use caution if you receive a text\r\nmessage expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate an account, or\r\nverify your identity by calling a phone number or submitting information on a website. These\r\nmessages may be part of a phishing scam conducted by fraudsters in an attempt to capture your\r\nconfidential account information and may be used to commit fraud.\r\n<strong>Paper mail or fax phishing</strong>\r\nSome fraudsters still use low-tech methods to obtain your personal and financial information.\r\nPhishing attempts can be made through regular mail or fax machines. If you are suspicious about\r\na piece of mail or fax you have received requesting personal or financial information, you should\r\ndiscard it. If youâve responded to a mail or fax phish and provided personal or financial\r\ninformation, contact the company the mail or fax appears to be from. Use a legitimate source\r\nsuch as the phone number listed on the company''s website, billing statement, or on the back of\r\nyour ATM, debit or credit card to let the company know that your information was\r\ncompromised.\r\n<strong>Reduce Your Risk</strong>\r\nReplace paper invoices, statements and checks with electronic versions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Safety Tip</strong>\r\nNever open attachments, click on links, or respond to emails from suspicious or unknown\r\nsenders.\r\n<strong>Learn to Recognize Fraudulent Emails</strong>\r\nFraudulent emails (phish) and websites can be very sophisticated, and may look identical to\r\nyour Bankâs emails and websites. Fraudsters can even tamper with the sender information in\r\nan email to make their phish look even more legitimate. Although fraudsters use various tactics\r\nin their phish, there are common elements you should familiarize yourself with.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Awkward greeting</strong>\r\nA phish may address the customer with a nonsensical greeting or may not refer to the customer\r\nby name.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Typos</strong>\r\nThis is not because fraudsters do not know how to spell â it is so the phish would not be blocked\r\nby email filters.\r\nExamples in this phish: âacessedâ âOur SSL security âseversâ has...â âfradulentâ\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>3.

Remember that you can always type a URL\r\ninto your web browser instead of clicking on a link.\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Compelling or urgent language</strong>\r\nAn urgent need to communicate with you for your own security, or a request to update your\r\ninformation immediately.\r\nExamples in this phish: âWe recently contacted you after noticing an issue on your online\r\naccount, which has been acessed unusually.â\r\nâOur security department has requested information from you to verify your identity for your\r\nonline banking.â\r\n<strong> 6.

Fraudsters, also known as phishers, send an email to a wide audience that appears to come from a reputable company.\r\nThis is known as a phish email.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn the phish email, there are links to spoof websites that imitate a reputable companyâs website.\r\nFraudsters hope to convince victims to share their personal information by using clever and compelling language, such as an urgent need for you to update your information immediately or a need to communicate with you for your own safety or security. Once obtained, your personal\r\ninformation can be used to steal money or transfer stolen money into another account.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUse caution if you receive an email expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate your online banking account, or verify your identity by clicking on a link.\r\nThese emails may be part of a phish scam conducted by fraudsters to capture your confidential account information and commit fraud.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>How fraudsters obtain email addresses</strong>\r\n\r\nFraudsters obtain email addresses from many places on the Internet. They also purchase email\r\nlists and sometimes guess email addresses. Fraudsters generally have no idea if people to whom they send banking-related phish emails are actual bank customers. Their hope is that a percentage of those phish emails will be received by actual bank customers.\r\n\r\nIf you receive a fraudulent email that appears to come from your Bank, this does not mean that your email address, name, or any other information has been taken from your Bankâs systems.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Fraudulent websites (phish or spoof websites)</strong>\r\n\r\nFraudsters may attempt to direct you to spoof websites via emails, pop-up windows or text messages. These websites are used to try to obtain your personal information. One way to detect\r\na phony website is to consider how you got to the site. Use caution if you may have followed a link in a suspicious email, text message, online chat or other pop-up window requesting your personal or account information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Variations on phishing attacks</span></strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Pop-up windows</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong></strong>Fraudsters may use pop-up windows â small windows or ads â to obtain personal information.\r\nThese windows may be generated by programs hidden in free downloads such as screen savers\r\nor music-sharing software. To protect yourself from harmful pop-up windows, avoid\r\ndownloading programs from unknown sources on the Internet and always run anti-virus software\r\non your computer.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>Telephone or voice phishing</strong>\r\nKnown as vishing, or voice phishing, this tactic is a phishing attempt made through a telephone\r\ncall or voice message. Fraudsters may have the ability to spoof their caller ID so it could appear\r\nthat the telephone call is coming from a legitimate company. Fraudsters may also have\r\nidentifying customer information, such as your name, which they may use to make the call\r\nappear more authentic.\r\nIf you are uncomfortable with a phone call that was not initiated by you, hang up or ask for the\r\npurpose of the call. Then, contact the company using legitimate sources such as contact phone\r\nnumbers found on the companyâs website, your bank statements, and those listed on your ATM,\r\ndebit or credit card.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>Text-message phishing</strong>\r\nA phishing attempt sent via SMS (Short Message Service) or text message to a mobile phone or\r\ndevice. This tactic is also referred to as smishing, which is a combination of SMS and phishing.\r\nThe purpose of text message phishing is the same as traditional email phishing: convince\r\nrecipients to share their sensitive or personal information.\r\nNever take action on a request for your personal or financial information, including account\r\nnumbers, passwords, Social Security number or birth date. Use caution if you receive a text\r\nmessage expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate an account, or\r\nverify your identity by calling a phone number or submitting information on a website. These\r\nmessages may be part of a phishing scam conducted by fraudsters in an attempt to capture your\r\nconfidential account information and may be used to commit fraud.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>Paper mail or fax phishing</strong>\r\nSome fraudsters still use low-tech methods to obtain your personal and financial information.\r\nPhishing attempts can be made through regular mail or fax machines. If you are suspicious about\r\na piece of mail or fax you have received requesting personal or financial information, you should\r\ndiscard it. If youâve responded to a mail or fax phish and provided personal or financial\r\ninformation, contact the company the mail or fax appears to be from. Use a legitimate source\r\nsuch as the phone number listed on the company''s website, billing statement, or on the back of\r\nyour ATM, debit or credit card to let the company know that your information was\r\ncompromised.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>Reduce Your Risk</strong>\r\nReplace paper invoices, statements and checks with electronic versions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Safety Tip</strong>\r\nNever open attachments, click on links, or respond to emails from suspicious or unknown\r\nsenders.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>Learn to Recognize Fraudulent Emails</strong>\r\nFraudulent emails (phish) and websites can be very sophisticated, and may look identical to\r\nyour Bankâs emails and websites. Fraudsters can even tamper with the sender information in\r\nan email to make their phish look even more legitimate. Although fraudsters use various tactics\r\nin their phish, there are common elements you should familiarize yourself with.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>1.

Install, run, and keep anti-virus software updated.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Fraudulent emails(phishing)</strong>\r\n\r\nPhishing is usually a two-part scam involving emails and spoof websites. Fraudsters, also known as phishers, send an email to a wide audience that appears to come from a reputable company.\r\nThis is known as a phish email.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn the phish email, there are links to spoof websites that imitate a reputable companyâs website.\r\nFraudsters hope to convince victims to share their personal information by using clever and compelling language, such as an urgent need for you to update your information immediately or a need to communicate with you for your own safety or security. Once obtained, your personal\r\ninformation can be used to steal money or transfer stolen money into another account.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUse caution if you receive an email expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate your online banking account, or verify your identity by clicking on a link.\r\nThese emails may be part of a phish scam conducted by fraudsters to capture your confidential account information and commit fraud.\r\n<strong>How fraudsters obtain email addresses</strong>\r\n\r\nFraudsters obtain email addresses from many places on the Internet. They also purchase email\r\nlists and sometimes guess email addresses. Fraudsters generally have no idea if people to whom they send banking-related phish emails are actual bank customers. Their hope is that a percentage of those phish emails will be received by actual bank customers.\r\n\r\nIf you receive a fraudulent email that appears to come from your Bank, this does not mean that your email address, name, or any other information has been taken from your Bankâs systems.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Fraudulent websites (phish or spoof websites)</strong>\r\n\r\nFraudsters may attempt to direct you to spoof websites via emails, pop-up windows or text messages. These websites are used to try to obtain your personal information. One way to detect\r\na phony website is to consider how you got to the site. Use caution if you may have followed a link in a suspicious email, text message, online chat or other pop-up window requesting your personal or account information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Variations on phishing attacks</span></strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Pop-up windows</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong></strong>Fraudsters may use pop-up windows â small windows or ads â to obtain personal information.\r\nThese windows may be generated by programs hidden in free downloads such as screen savers\r\nor music-sharing software. To protect yourself from harmful pop-up windows, avoid\r\ndownloading programs from unknown sources on the Internet and always run anti-virus software\r\non your computer.\r\n<strong>Telephone or voice phishing</strong>\r\nKnown as vishing, or voice phishing, this tactic is a phishing attempt made through a telephone\r\ncall or voice message. Fraudsters may have the ability to spoof their caller ID so it could appear\r\nthat the telephone call is coming from a legitimate company. Fraudsters may also have\r\nidentifying customer information, such as your name, which they may use to make the call\r\nappear more authentic.\r\nIf you are uncomfortable with a phone call that was not initiated by you, hang up or ask for the\r\npurpose of the call. Then, contact the company using legitimate sources such as contact phone\r\nnumbers found on the companyâs website, your bank statements, and those listed on your ATM,\r\ndebit or credit card.\r\n<strong>Text-message phishing</strong>\r\nA phishing attempt sent via SMS (Short Message Service) or text message to a mobile phone or\r\ndevice. This tactic is also referred to as smishing, which is a combination of SMS and phishing.\r\nThe purpose of text message phishing is the same as traditional email phishing: convince\r\nrecipients to share their sensitive or personal information.\r\nNever take action on a request for your personal or financial information, including account\r\nnumbers, passwords, Social Security number or birth date. Use caution if you receive a text\r\nmessage expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate an account, or\r\nverify your identity by calling a phone number or submitting information on a website. These\r\nmessages may be part of a phishing scam conducted by fraudsters in an attempt to capture your\r\nconfidential account information and may be used to commit fraud.\r\n<strong>Paper mail or fax phishing</strong>\r\nSome fraudsters still use low-tech methods to obtain your personal and financial information.\r\nPhishing attempts can be made through regular mail or fax machines. If you are suspicious about\r\na piece of mail or fax you have received requesting personal or financial information, you should\r\ndiscard it. If youâve responded to a mail or fax phish and provided personal or financial\r\ninformation, contact the company the mail or fax appears to be from. Use a legitimate source\r\nsuch as the phone number listed on the company''s website, billing statement, or on the back of\r\nyour ATM, debit or credit card to let the company know that your information was\r\ncompromised.\r\n<strong>Reduce Your Risk</strong>\r\nReplace paper invoices, statements and checks with electronic versions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Safety Tip</strong>\r\nNever open attachments, click on links, or respond to emails from suspicious or unknown\r\nsenders.\r\n<strong>Learn to Recognize Fraudulent Emails</strong>\r\nFraudulent emails (phish) and websites can be very sophisticated, and may look identical to\r\nyour Bankâs emails and websites. Fraudsters can even tamper with the sender information in\r\nan email to make their phish look even more legitimate.

It should also look at surviving significant losses of resources such as staff or equipment.

Business Impact Assessment (BIA)\r\n2. Business Continuity Plan development\r\n3. Staff Training\r\n4. Business Continuity Plan Validation: Drills and Exercises\r\n5.

The joint team will also analyze the client''s current overall business continuity management planning efforts. The BIA is a diagnostic survey that consists of issue analyses, risk identification, and assessment of potential business impacts and crisis situations. The diagnostic survey assists us to determine the client current capabilities, level of training, and categorization of potential business disruption situations. The review of current initiatives will include:</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">1. Current Business Continuity Plan/Program Review\r\n2. Corporate Office Capabilities (Assignment of Responsibility)\r\n3. Identification of Resources (Internal, External)\r\n4. Categorization of Potential Issues, Threats, Risks, Business Impacts and Crisis Situations\r\n5. Crisis Communications Systems (including media &amp; security)\r\n6. Current Level of Training\r\n7. Interface Mechanisms</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Our approach generally will be to:</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Interview Key Personnel</b>: The personnel interviews will review business operations, current business continuity initiatives, general information on business continuity management and emergency preparedness, incident scenarios, policy, compliance initiatives, crisis media response, internal/external interfaces (infrastructures), business risks, strategic direction, documentation and training.</span></span>\r\n\r\n<b>Review Current Written Business Continuity Plans and Materials</b>: This review will consist of a comparison of the present Business Continuity Plan Manuals and Supporting Materials against applicable corporate policies, procedures and applicable requirements. Recommendations for improvements will be made as a part of this review.\r\n<h4>Phase 2: Business Continuity Plan Development</h4>\r\n<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Our approach is to assist the client''s management in designing, developing and implementing a Business Continuity Plan, as follows:</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">1. Develop draft BCP materials.\r\n2. Review the draft materials with key personnel.\r\n3. Prepare final BCP materials.</span></span>\r\n<h4>Phase 3: Key Staff Training</h4>\r\n<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Development and implementation of staff training based on the Business Continuity Plan developed in Phase 2, as follows:</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">1. Develop draft BCP Training Program.\r\n2. Review the draft material with key client personnel.\r\n3. Develop final BCP Training Program.\r\n4. Schedule and Conduct BCP Training.</span></span>\r\n<h4>Phase 4: Plan Validation: Drills and Exercises</h4>\r\n<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Validation of the Business Continuity Plan through the development and implementation of a comprehensive drill and exercise program, as follows:</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">1. Develop draft Business Continuity Plan Drill Scenarios.\r\n2. Review the draft material with key client personnel.\r\n3. Develop final Business Continuity Plan Drill Scenarios.\r\n4. Develop draft Drill Participant, Controller, Evaluator Training Program.\r\n5. Review the draft material with key client personnel.\r\n6. Develop Drill Participant, Controller, and Evaluator Training Program.\r\n7. Schedule and Conduct Drill Participant, Controller, Evaluator Training\r\n8. Schedule and Conduct Drills and Exercises.</span></span>\r\n<h4>Phase 5: Program Effectiveness Evaluation and Monitoring</h4>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Upon completion of the initial four phases of the Business Continuity Plan program, BCM team will do periodic third party assessment and monitoring of the effectiveness of the Business Continuity Plan, Level of Training and Plan Validation process. The evaluation program, presented herein, is designed to assess the ability of management and response personnel to complete the sequence of critical tasks, under a business disruption condition, using available resources as outlined in the plan and associated materials.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The findings in relation to the organization''s ability to meet the criteria for "All Hazards" preparedness is based upon the evaluation of nine Essential Element of Analysis (EEA). These are:</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">1. Administration (BCMP and Supporting Materials)\r\n2. Incident Management/Response Organization\r\n3. Training and Retraining Program\r\n4. BCMP Facilities and Equipment\r\n5. BCMP Implementing Protocols\r\n6. Coordination with External Entities\r\n7. BCMP Validation: Drills and Exercises\r\n8. Communications\r\n9. Ongoing Hazard/Vulnerability/Risk Evaluation</span></span>\r\n<h2>Summary</h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This plan is subject to revision based on client needs and preferences.

Whilst this must be worthwhile in itself, there are other benefits that can be gained by embracing BCM as a management discipline. Some organizations have statutory and regulatory requirements either specifically for BCM or more generally for ârisk managementâ as part of their corporate governance requirement. An appropriate BCM plan will satisfy both the specific requirements and contribute both a response to specific risks and to the overall ârisk awarenessâ of an organization. However the primary driver for BCM should always be that it is undertaken because it adds value to an organization and the products and services it delivers rather than because of governance or regulatory considerations.</p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">âFor many companies, BCM will address someâ¦key risks and help them achieve compliance".

Although there is no industry standard for the contents of such a plan, Securitysense has recommended organizations by using a model that has proved to be an effective communication tool with the numerous interested parties (including senior management), as well as a reasonable tracking mechanism for multiyear progress reports. While the model can be applied by organizations of any size and in any industry, the details vary based on the scale of the organization and the starting maturity level of the various effected organizational units.</span></span></p>\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The information security strategic plan should not be viewed as a stand-alone document. It should exist as one part of a set of planning documents that start with a charter and a vision statement, but that also extends beyond the strategic plan into tactical and communications plans. Each of these has a role in providing context and action ability for the strategic plan. Organizations that have an established enterprise architecture (EA) function should leverage the existing EA disciplines, processes and standards to ensure that the strategic plan for information security is aligned with the EA strategy (see "Architecting Security: Different Approaches"). Securitysense generally considers three years to be an appropriate window for strategic planning for information security. The charter and vision statements deal with longer-term directions, while the tactical and communications plans specify single-year operational considerations and projects.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The basic layout of the strategic plan is:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Introduction and executive summary</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Strategic plan framework description</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Current state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Desired state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Gap analysis</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Prioritization plan</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Roles and responsibilities</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Introduction and Executive Summary</b></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The introduction should be written first, setting the purpose and scope of the document. The executive summary should be written last, showing only the final points of the document. The combination of executive summary and introduction should not exceed three pages, and, for most organizations, should be no more than two pages.</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Strategic Plan Framework Description</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The framework is the method by which the current state, desired state and gap analysis will be documented. An appropriate framework is one that can show overview (summarized) and detail (planning) information. The summary information should be expressed graphically. Frameworks should encompass controls, architecture and process elements to be complete.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">For organizations with an established EA practice, an enterprise information security architecture (EISA) framework (see "The Structure and Content of an Information Security Architecture Framework") that aligns with the EA framework can act as an effective overall strategic security planning framework. Frameworks for this purpose can be derived from industry standards, from Securitysense research or from a combination of the two. </span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some sources for framework structure and contents are:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Controls</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electro technical</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Commission (IEC) 27002</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-53</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Architecture</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO10181</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO13335</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Processes</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO/IEC 27001</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</span></span>\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In addition, Securitysense research can provide significant examples and guidelines for constructing such a framework (see the Recommended Reading section below). Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Three years is not a long time to achieve any sort of cultural change, nor for a significant reduction in the overall level of risk. Using a maturity scale from zero through five, with steps of one-half for each of the framework elements, allows sufficient granularity to show, at a strategic level, what degree of progress is being attempted. Brief text descriptions contain the background for each target value. Securitysense recommends that a change in maturity level of no more than a "2" be attempted for any framework element in a three-year period, unless exceptional resources and executive support can be assured (see Figure 3 for an example based on Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 3.

Part of the three-year strategic plan should be guidance to tactical planners on how to prioritize the closure of those gaps, such that any natural order is optimized. Controls determine what should be achieved, but controls become meaningful only if the governance structure is functional. The IT organization needs direction via technical architecture to be efficient, but architecture requires guidance from controls. Operational processes related to technologies that are already in place depend, to some degree, on controls (what processes and technologies are needed) and architecture (which process elements and technologies are automated). As a result, a normal prioritization plan might be to start with governance, move to controls, then architecture and finally process. But this is a "greenfield" approach, and it may not be appropriate for organizations with variable levels of maturity in the current information security program or IT organizations in general. For example, a lack of maturity in strategic processes, such as risk assessment and security communications, which are not technology-dependent may demand earlier prioritization.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore, the method by which priorities will be assigned in the tactical plans requires some</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">strategic guidance. More-granular prioritization of work should be included in tactical (annual) planning documents, and should be based on criteria such as the relative risk impact, the cost, the mean time to value and the availability of resources.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This section describes who is responsible for delivering and who is responsible for approving each strategic and tactical deliverable that results from this strategic plan.

The authority, rights and obligations of LOB management and the IT organization should have been negotiated via the governance structure prior to, or as part of, the creation of this strategic plan. These authorities, rights and obligations are typically governed via some kind of information security steering committee. Other business areas may be surprised by their inclusion or may have expressed a need for involvement on their own, typically as a response to regulatory compliance needs.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One approach to documenting these roles and responsibilities that has been widely accepted by organization is the use of a responsible, accountable, consulted and informed (RACI) matrix.

The joint team will also analyze the client''s current overall business continuity management planning efforts. The BIA is a diagnostic survey that consists of issue analyses, risk identification, and assessment of potential business impacts and crisis situations. The diagnostic survey assists us to determine the client current capabilities, level of training, and categorization of potential business disruption situations. The review of current initiatives will include:</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">1.

Whilst this must be worthwhile in itself, there are other benefits that can be gained by embracing BCM as a management discipline. Some organizations have statutory and regulatory requirements either specifically for BCM or more generally for ârisk managementâ as part of their corporate governance requirement. An appropriate BCM plan will satisfy both the specific requirements and contribute both a response to specific risks and to the overall ârisk awarenessâ of an organization. However the primary driver for BCM should always be that it is undertaken because it adds value to an organization and the products and services it delivers rather than because of governance or regulatory considerations.</p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">âFor many companies, BCM will address someâ¦key risks and help them achieve compliance".

Although there is no industry standard for the contents of such a plan, Securitysense has recommended organizations by using a model that has proved to be an effective communication tool with the numerous interested parties (including senior management), as well as a reasonable tracking mechanism for multiyear progress reports. While the model can be applied by organizations of any size and in any industry, the details vary based on the scale of the organization and the starting maturity level of the various effected organizational units.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The information security strategic plan should not be viewed as a stand-alone document. It should exist as one part of a set of planning documents that start with a charter and a vision statement, but that also extends beyond the strategic plan into tactical and communications plans. Each of these has a role in providing context and action ability for the strategic plan. Organizations that have an established enterprise architecture (EA) function should leverage the existing EA disciplines, processes and standards to ensure that the strategic plan for information security is aligned with the EA strategy (see "Architecting Security: Different Approaches"). Securitysense generally considers three years to be an appropriate window for strategic planning for information security. The charter and vision statements deal with longer-term directions, while the tactical and communications plans specify single-year operational considerations and projects.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The basic layout of the strategic plan is:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Introduction and executive summary</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Strategic plan framework description</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Current state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Desired state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Gap analysis</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Prioritization plan</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Roles and responsibilities</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Introduction and Executive Summary</b></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The introduction should be written first, setting the purpose and scope of the document. The executive summary should be written last, showing only the final points of the document. The combination of executive summary and introduction should not exceed three pages, and, for most organizations, should be no more than two pages.</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Strategic Plan Framework Description</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The framework is the method by which the current state, desired state and gap analysis will be documented. An appropriate framework is one that can show overview (summarized) and detail (planning) information. The summary information should be expressed graphically. Frameworks should encompass controls, architecture and process elements to be complete.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">For organizations with an established EA practice, an enterprise information security architecture (EISA) framework (see "The Structure and Content of an Information Security Architecture Framework") that aligns with the EA framework can act as an effective overall strategic security planning framework. Frameworks for this purpose can be derived from industry standards, from Securitysense research or from a combination of the two. </span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some sources for framework structure and contents are:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Controls</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electro technical</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Commission (IEC) 27002</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-53</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Architecture</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO10181</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO13335</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Processes</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO/IEC 27001</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In addition, Securitysense research can provide significant examples and guidelines for constructing such a framework (see the Recommended Reading section below). Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Brief text descriptions contain the background for each target value. Securitysense recommends that a change in maturity level of no more than a "2" be attempted for any framework element in a three-year period, unless exceptional resources and executive support can be assured (see Figure 3 for an example based on Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 3.

Part of the three-year strategic plan should be guidance to tactical planners on how to prioritize the closure of those gaps, such that any natural order is optimized. Controls determine what should be achieved, but controls become meaningful only if the governance structure is functional. The IT organization needs direction via technical architecture to be efficient, but architecture requires guidance from controls. Operational processes related to technologies that are already in place depend, to some degree, on controls (what processes and technologies are needed) and architecture (which process elements and technologies are automated). As a result, a normal prioritization plan might be to start with governance, move to controls, then architecture and finally process. But this is a "greenfield" approach, and it may not be appropriate for organizations with variable levels of maturity in the current information security program or IT organizations in general. For example, a lack of maturity in strategic processes, such as risk assessment and security communications, which are not technology-dependent may demand earlier prioritization.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore, the method by which priorities will be assigned in the tactical plans requires some</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">strategic guidance. More-granular prioritization of work should be included in tactical (annual) planning documents, and should be based on criteria such as the relative risk impact, the cost, the mean time to value and the availability of resources.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This section describes who is responsible for delivering and who is responsible for approving each strategic and tactical deliverable that results from this strategic plan.

The authority, rights and obligations of LOB management and the IT organization should have been negotiated via the governance structure prior to, or as part of, the creation of this strategic plan. These authorities, rights and obligations are typically governed via some kind of information security steering committee. Other business areas may be surprised by their inclusion or may have expressed a need for involvement on their own, typically as a response to regulatory compliance needs.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One approach to documenting these roles and responsibilities that has been widely accepted by organization is the use of a responsible, accountable, consulted and informed (RACI) matrix.

Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Three years is not a long time to achieve any sort of cultural change, nor for a significant reduction in the overall level of risk.

Brief text descriptions contain the background for each target value. Securitysense recommends that a change in maturity level of no more than a "2" be attempted for any framework element in a three-year period, unless exceptional resources and executive support can be assured (see Figure 3 for an example based on Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 3.

Part of the three-year strategic plan should be guidance to tactical planners on how to prioritize the closure of those gaps, such that any natural order is optimized. Controls determine what should be achieved, but controls become meaningful only if the governance structure is functional. The IT organization needs direction via technical architecture to be efficient, but architecture requires guidance from controls. Operational processes related to technologies that are already in place depend, to some degree, on controls (what processes and technologies are needed) and architecture (which process elements and technologies are automated). As a result, a normal prioritization plan might be to start with governance, move to controls, then architecture and finally process. But this is a "greenfield" approach, and it may not be appropriate for organizations with variable levels of maturity in the current information security program or IT organizations in general. For example, a lack of maturity in strategic processes, such as risk assessment and security communications, which are not technology-dependent may demand earlier prioritization.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore, the method by which priorities will be assigned in the tactical plans requires some</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">strategic guidance. More-granular prioritization of work should be included in tactical (annual) planning documents, and should be based on criteria such as the relative risk impact, the cost, the mean time to value and the availability of resources.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This section describes who is responsible for delivering and who is responsible for approving each strategic and tactical deliverable that results from this strategic plan. There are four sets of organizational areas that need to be mapped to deliverables and action plans:</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The security office</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Lines of business (LOBs) or federation issues (responsibilities that reside with persons or departments </span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">that are affiliated with, but not reporting to, the central information security function)</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The IT organization</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Other business areas (typically, the functions that go on in headquarters, such as legal, HR and finance)</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The security office''s responsibilities should be easily extracted from the security charter. The authority, rights and obligations of LOB management and the IT organization should have been negotiated via the governance structure prior to, or as part of, the creation of this strategic plan. These authorities, rights and obligations are typically governed via some kind of information security steering committee. Other business areas may be surprised by their inclusion or may have expressed a need for involvement on their own, typically as a response to regulatory compliance needs.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One approach to documenting these roles and responsibilities that has been widely accepted by organization is the use of a responsible, accountable, consulted and informed (RACI) matrix. Once all these steps have been outlined, the executive summary can be written.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Security Strategy', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '398-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-08-28 13:29:03', '2013-08-28 13:29:03', '', 398, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?p=402', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Part of the three-year strategic plan should be guidance to tactical planners on how to prioritize the closure of those gaps, such that any natural order is optimized. Controls determine what should be achieved, but controls become meaningful only if the governance structure is functional. The IT organization needs direction via technical architecture to be efficient, but architecture requires guidance from controls. Operational processes related to technologies that are already in place depend, to some degree, on controls (what processes and technologies are needed) and architecture (which process elements and technologies are automated). As a result, a normal prioritization plan might be to start with governance, move to controls, then architecture and finally process. But this is a "greenfield" approach, and it may not be appropriate for organizations with variable levels of maturity in the current information security program or IT organizations in general. For example, a lack of maturity in strategic processes, such as risk assessment and security communications, which are not technology-dependent may demand earlier prioritization.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore, the method by which priorities will be assigned in the tactical plans requires some</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">strategic guidance. More-granular prioritization of work should be included in tactical (annual) planning documents, and should be based on criteria such as the relative risk impact, the cost, the mean time to value and the availability of resources.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This section describes who is responsible for delivering and who is responsible for approving each strategic and tactical deliverable that results from this strategic plan. There are four sets of organizational areas that need to be mapped to deliverables and action plans:</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The security office</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Lines of business (LOBs) or federation issues (responsibilities that reside with persons or departments </span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">that are affiliated with, but not reporting to, the central information security function)</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The IT organization</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Other business areas (typically, the functions that go on in headquarters, such as legal, HR and finance)</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The security office''s responsibilities should be easily extracted from the security charter. The authority, rights and obligations of LOB management and the IT organization should have been negotiated via the governance structure prior to, or as part of, the creation of this strategic plan. These authorities, rights and obligations are typically governed via some kind of information security steering committee. Other business areas may be surprised by their inclusion or may have expressed a need for involvement on their own, typically as a response to regulatory compliance needs.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One approach to documenting these roles and responsibilities that has been widely accepted by organization is the use of a responsible, accountable, consulted and informed (RACI) matrix. Once all these steps have been outlined, the executive summary can be written.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Security Strategy', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '398-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-08-28 13:40:48', '2013-08-28 13:40:48', '', 398, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?p=405', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Although there is no industry standard for the contents of such a plan, Securitysense has recommended organizations by using a model that has proved to be an effective communication tool with the numerous interested parties (including senior management), as well as a reasonable tracking mechanism for multiyear progress reports. While the model can be applied by organizations of any size and in any industry, the details vary based on the scale of the organization and the starting maturity level of the various effected organizational units.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The information security strategic plan should not be viewed as a stand-alone document. It should exist as one part of a set of planning documents that start with a charter and a vision statement, but that also extends beyond the strategic plan into tactical and communications plans. Each of these has a role in providing context and action ability for the strategic plan. Organizations that have an established enterprise architecture (EA) function should leverage the existing EA disciplines, processes and standards to ensure that the strategic plan for information security is aligned with the EA strategy (see "Architecting Security: Different Approaches"). Securitysense generally considers three years to be an appropriate window for strategic planning for information security. The charter and vision statements deal with longer-term directions, while the tactical and communications plans specify single-year operational considerations and projects.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The basic layout of the strategic plan is:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Introduction and executive summary</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Strategic plan framework description</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Current state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Desired state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Gap analysis</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Prioritization plan</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Roles and responsibilities</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Introduction and Executive Summary</b></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The introduction should be written first, setting the purpose and scope of the document.

Although there is no industry standard for the contents of such a plan, Securitysense has recommended organizations by using a model that has proved to be an effective communication tool with the numerous interested parties (including senior management), as well as a reasonable tracking mechanism for multiyear progress reports. While the model can be applied by organizations of any size and in any industry, the details vary based on the scale of the organization and the starting maturity level of the various effected organizational units.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The information security strategic plan should not be viewed as a stand-alone document. It should exist as one part of a set of planning documents that start with a charter and a vision statement, but that also extends beyond the strategic plan into tactical and communications plans. Each of these has a role in providing context and action ability for the strategic plan. Organizations that have an established enterprise architecture (EA) function should leverage the existing EA disciplines, processes and standards to ensure that the strategic plan for information security is aligned with the EA strategy (see "Architecting Security: Different Approaches"). Securitysense generally considers three years to be an appropriate window for strategic planning for information security. The charter and vision statements deal with longer-term directions, while the tactical and communications plans specify single-year operational considerations and projects.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The basic layout of the strategic plan is:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Introduction and executive summary</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Strategic plan framework description</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Current state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Desired state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Gap analysis</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Prioritization plan</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Roles and responsibilities</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Introduction and Executive Summary</b></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The introduction should be written first, setting the purpose and scope of the document. The executive summary should be written last, showing only the final points of the document. The combination of executive summary and introduction should not exceed three pages, and, for most organizations, should be no more than two pages.</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Strategic Plan Framework Description</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The framework is the method by which the current state, desired state and gap analysis will be documented. An appropriate framework is one that can show overview (summarized) and detail (planning) information. The summary information should be expressed graphically. Frameworks should encompass controls, architecture and process elements to be complete.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">For organizations with an established EA practice, an enterprise information security architecture (EISA) framework (see "The Structure and Content of an Information Security Architecture Framework") that aligns with the EA framework can act as an effective overall strategic security planning framework. Frameworks for this purpose can be derived from industry standards, from Securitysense research or from a combination of the two. </span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some sources for framework structure and contents are:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Controls</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electro technical</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Commission (IEC) 27002</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-53</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Architecture</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO10181</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO13335</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Processes</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO/IEC 27001</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In addition, Securitysense research can provide significant examples and guidelines for constructing such a framework (see the Recommended Reading section below). Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Brief text descriptions contain the background for each target value.

Although there is no industry standard for the contents of such a plan, Securitysense has recommended organizations by using a model that has proved to be an effective communication tool with the numerous interested parties (including senior management), as well as a reasonable tracking mechanism for multiyear progress reports. While the model can be applied by organizations of any size and in any industry, the details vary based on the scale of the organization and the starting maturity level of the various effected organizational units.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The information security strategic plan should not be viewed as a stand-alone document. It should exist as one part of a set of planning documents that start with a charter and a vision statement, but that also extends beyond the strategic plan into tactical and communications plans. Each of these has a role in providing context and action ability for the strategic plan. Organizations that have an established enterprise architecture (EA) function should leverage the existing EA disciplines, processes and standards to ensure that the strategic plan for information security is aligned with the EA strategy (see "Architecting Security: Different Approaches"). Securitysense generally considers three years to be an appropriate window for strategic planning for information security. The charter and vision statements deal with longer-term directions, while the tactical and communications plans specify single-year operational considerations and projects.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The basic layout of the strategic plan is:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Introduction and executive summary</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Strategic plan framework description</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Current state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Desired state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Gap analysis</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Prioritization plan</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Roles and responsibilities</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Introduction and Executive Summary</b></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The introduction should be written first, setting the purpose and scope of the document. The executive summary should be written last, showing only the final points of the document. The combination of executive summary and introduction should not exceed three pages, and, for most organizations, should be no more than two pages.</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Strategic Plan Framework Description</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The framework is the method by which the current state, desired state and gap analysis will be documented. An appropriate framework is one that can show overview (summarized) and detail (planning) information. The summary information should be expressed graphically. Frameworks should encompass controls, architecture and process elements to be complete.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">For organizations with an established EA practice, an enterprise information security architecture (EISA) framework (see "The Structure and Content of an Information Security Architecture Framework") that aligns with the EA framework can act as an effective overall strategic security planning framework. Frameworks for this purpose can be derived from industry standards, from Securitysense research or from a combination of the two. </span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some sources for framework structure and contents are:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Controls</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electro technical</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Commission (IEC) 27002</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-53</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Architecture</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO10181</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO13335</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Processes</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO/IEC 27001</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In addition, Securitysense research can provide significant examples and guidelines for constructing such a framework (see the Recommended Reading section below). Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior.

Part of the three-year strategic plan should be guidance to tactical planners on how to prioritize the closure of those gaps, such that any natural order is optimized. Controls determine what should be achieved, but controls become meaningful only if the governance structure is functional. The IT organization needs direction via technical architecture to be efficient, but architecture requires guidance from controls. Operational processes related to technologies that are already in place depend, to some degree, on controls (what processes and technologies are needed) and architecture (which process elements and technologies are automated). As a result, a normal prioritization plan might be to start with governance, move to controls, then architecture and finally process. But this is a "greenfield" approach, and it may not be appropriate for organizations with variable levels of maturity in the current information security program or IT organizations in general. For example, a lack of maturity in strategic processes, such as risk assessment and security communications, which are not technology-dependent may demand earlier prioritization.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore, the method by which priorities will be assigned in the tactical plans requires some</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">strategic guidance. More-granular prioritization of work should be included in tactical (annual) planning documents, and should be based on criteria such as the relative risk impact, the cost, the mean time to value and the availability of resources.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This section describes who is responsible for delivering and who is responsible for approving each strategic and tactical deliverable that results from this strategic plan. There are four sets of organizational areas that need to be mapped to deliverables and action plans:</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The security office</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Lines of business (LOBs) or federation issues (responsibilities that reside with persons or departments </span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">that are affiliated with, but not reporting to, the central information security function)</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The IT organization</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Other business areas (typically, the functions that go on in headquarters, such as legal, HR and finance)</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The security office''s responsibilities should be easily extracted from the security charter. The authority, rights and obligations of LOB management and the IT organization should have been negotiated via the governance structure prior to, or as part of, the creation of this strategic plan. These authorities, rights and obligations are typically governed via some kind of information security steering committee. Other business areas may be surprised by their inclusion or may have expressed a need for involvement on their own, typically as a response to regulatory compliance needs.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One approach to documenting these roles and responsibilities that has been widely accepted by organization is the use of a responsible, accountable, consulted and informed (RACI) matrix. Once all these steps have been outlined, the executive summary can be written.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Security Strategy', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '398-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-08-28 16:33:39', '2013-08-28 16:33:39', '', 398, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?p=443', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Although there is no industry standard for the contents of such a plan, Securitysense has recommended organizations by using a model that has proved to be an effective communication tool with the numerous interested parties (including senior management), as well as a reasonable tracking mechanism for multiyear progress reports. While the model can be applied by organizations of any size and in any industry, the details vary based on the scale of the organization and the starting maturity level of the various effected organizational units.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The information security strategic plan should not be viewed as a stand-alone document. It should exist as one part of a set of planning documents that start with a charter and a vision statement, but that also extends beyond the strategic plan into tactical and communications plans. Each of these has a role in providing context and action ability for the strategic plan. Organizations that have an established enterprise architecture (EA) function should leverage the existing EA disciplines, processes and standards to ensure that the strategic plan for information security is aligned with the EA strategy (see "Architecting Security: Different Approaches"). Securitysense generally considers three years to be an appropriate window for strategic planning for information security. The charter and vision statements deal with longer-term directions, while the tactical and communications plans specify single-year operational considerations and projects.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The basic layout of the strategic plan is:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Introduction and executive summary</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Strategic plan framework description</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Current state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Desired state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Gap analysis</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Prioritization plan</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Roles and responsibilities</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Introduction and Executive Summary</b></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The introduction should be written first, setting the purpose and scope of the document. The executive summary should be written last, showing only the final points of the document. The combination of executive summary and introduction should not exceed three pages, and, for most organizations, should be no more than two pages.</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Strategic Plan Framework Description</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The framework is the method by which the current state, desired state and gap analysis will be documented. An appropriate framework is one that can show overview (summarized) and detail (planning) information. The summary information should be expressed graphically. Frameworks should encompass controls, architecture and process elements to be complete.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">For organizations with an established EA practice, an enterprise information security architecture (EISA) framework (see "The Structure and Content of an Information Security Architecture Framework") that aligns with the EA framework can act as an effective overall strategic security planning framework. Frameworks for this purpose can be derived from industry standards, from Securitysense research or from a combination of the two. </span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some sources for framework structure and contents are:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Controls</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electro technical</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Commission (IEC) 27002</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-53</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Architecture</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO10181</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO13335</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Processes</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO/IEC 27001</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In addition, Securitysense research can provide significant examples and guidelines for constructing such a framework (see the Recommended Reading section below). Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Although there is no industry standard for the contents of such a plan, Securitysense has recommended organizations by using a model that has proved to be an effective communication tool with the numerous interested parties (including senior management), as well as a reasonable tracking mechanism for multiyear progress reports. While the model can be applied by organizations of any size and in any industry, the details vary based on the scale of the organization and the starting maturity level of the various effected organizational units.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The information security strategic plan should not be viewed as a stand-alone document. It should exist as one part of a set of planning documents that start with a charter and a vision statement, but that also extends beyond the strategic plan into tactical and communications plans. Each of these has a role in providing context and action ability for the strategic plan. Organizations that have an established enterprise architecture (EA) function should leverage the existing EA disciplines, processes and standards to ensure that the strategic plan for information security is aligned with the EA strategy (see "Architecting Security: Different Approaches"). Securitysense generally considers three years to be an appropriate window for strategic planning for information security. The charter and vision statements deal with longer-term directions, while the tactical and communications plans specify single-year operational considerations and projects.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The basic layout of the strategic plan is:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Introduction and executive summary</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Strategic plan framework description</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Current state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Desired state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Gap analysis</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Prioritization plan</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Roles and responsibilities</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Introduction and Executive Summary</b></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The introduction should be written first, setting the purpose and scope of the document. The executive summary should be written last, showing only the final points of the document. The combination of executive summary and introduction should not exceed three pages, and, for most organizations, should be no more than two pages.</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Strategic Plan Framework Description</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The framework is the method by which the current state, desired state and gap analysis will be documented. An appropriate framework is one that can show overview (summarized) and detail (planning) information. The summary information should be expressed graphically. Frameworks should encompass controls, architecture and process elements to be complete.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">For organizations with an established EA practice, an enterprise information security architecture (EISA) framework (see "The Structure and Content of an Information Security Architecture Framework") that aligns with the EA framework can act as an effective overall strategic security planning framework. Frameworks for this purpose can be derived from industry standards, from Securitysense research or from a combination of the two. </span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some sources for framework structure and contents are:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Controls</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electro technical</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Commission (IEC) 27002</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-53</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Architecture</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO10181</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO13335</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Processes</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO/IEC 27001</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In addition, Securitysense research can provide significant examples and guidelines for constructing such a framework (see the Recommended Reading section below). Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Three years is not a long time to achieve any sort of cultural change, nor for a significant reduction in the overall level of risk. Using a maturity scale from zero through five, with steps of one-half for each of the framework elements, allows sufficient granularity to show, at a strategic level, what degree of progress is being attempted. Brief text descriptions contain the background for each target value. Securitysense recommends that a change in maturity level of no more than a "2" be attempted for any framework element in a three-year period, unless exceptional resources and executive support can be assured (see Figure 3 for an example based on Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 3.

Although there is no industry standard for the contents of such a plan, Securitysense has recommended organizations by using a model that has proved to be an effective communication tool with the numerous interested parties (including senior management), as well as a reasonable tracking mechanism for multiyear progress reports.

Each of these has a role in providing context and action ability for the strategic plan. Organizations that have an established enterprise architecture (EA) function should leverage the existing EA disciplines, processes and standards to ensure that the strategic plan for information security is aligned with the EA strategy (see "Architecting Security: Different Approaches"). Securitysense generally considers three years to be an appropriate window for strategic planning for information security.

An appropriate framework is one that can show overview (summarized) and detail (planning) information. The summary information should be expressed graphically. Frameworks should encompass controls, architecture and process elements to be complete.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">For organizations with an established EA practice, an enterprise information security architecture (EISA) framework (see "The Structure and Content of an Information Security Architecture Framework") that aligns with the EA framework can act as an effective overall strategic security planning framework. Frameworks for this purpose can be derived from industry standards, from Securitysense research or from a combination of the two. </span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some sources for framework structure and contents are:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Controls</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electro technical</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Commission (IEC) 27002</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-53</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Architecture</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO10181</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO13335</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Processes</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO/IEC 27001</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In addition, Securitysense research can provide significant examples and guidelines for constructing such a framework (see the Recommended Reading section below). Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Three years is not a long time to achieve any sort of cultural change, nor for a significant reduction in the overall level of risk.

Brief text descriptions contain the background for each target value. Securitysense recommends that a change in maturity level of no more than a "2" be attempted for any framework element in a three-year period, unless exceptional resources and executive support can be assured (see Figure 3 for an example based on Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 3.

Part of the three-year strategic plan should be guidance to tactical planners on how to prioritize the closure of those gaps, such that any natural order is optimized. Controls determine what should be achieved, but controls become meaningful only if the governance structure is functional. The IT organization needs direction via technical architecture to be efficient, but architecture requires guidance from controls. Operational processes related to technologies that are already in place depend, to some degree, on controls (what processes and technologies are needed) and architecture (which process elements and technologies are automated). As a result, a normal prioritization plan might be to start with governance, move to controls, then architecture and finally process. But this is a "greenfield" approach, and it may not be appropriate for organizations with variable levels of maturity in the current information security program or IT organizations in general. For example, a lack of maturity in strategic processes, such as risk assessment and security communications, which are not technology-dependent may demand earlier prioritization.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore, the method by which priorities will be assigned in the tactical plans requires some</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">strategic guidance. More-granular prioritization of work should be included in tactical (annual) planning documents, and should be based on criteria such as the relative risk impact, the cost, the mean time to value and the availability of resources.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This section describes who is responsible for delivering and who is responsible for approving each strategic and tactical deliverable that results from this strategic plan.

The authority, rights and obligations of LOB management and the IT organization should have been negotiated via the governance structure prior to, or as part of, the creation of this strategic plan.

Part of the three-year strategic plan should be guidance to tactical planners on how to prioritize the closure of those gaps, such that any natural order is optimized. Controls determine what should be achieved, but controls become meaningful only if the governance structure is functional. The IT organization needs direction via technical architecture to be efficient, but architecture requires guidance from controls. Operational processes related to technologies that are already in place depend, to some degree, on controls (what processes and technologies are needed) and architecture (which process elements and technologies are automated). As a result, a normal prioritization plan might be to start with governance, move to controls, then architecture and finally process. But this is a "greenfield" approach, and it may not be appropriate for organizations with variable levels of maturity in the current information security program or IT organizations in general. For example, a lack of maturity in strategic processes, such as risk assessment and security communications, which are not technology-dependent may demand earlier prioritization.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore, the method by which priorities will be assigned in the tactical plans requires some</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">strategic guidance. More-granular prioritization of work should be included in tactical (annual) planning documents, and should be based on criteria such as the relative risk impact, the cost, the mean time to value and the availability of resources.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This section describes who is responsible for delivering and who is responsible for approving each strategic and tactical deliverable that results from this strategic plan. There are four sets of organizational areas that need to be mapped to deliverables and action plans:</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The security office</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Lines of business (LOBs) or federation issues (responsibilities that reside with persons or departments </span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">that are affiliated with, but not reporting to, the central information security function)</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The IT organization</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Other business areas (typically, the functions that go on in headquarters, such as legal, HR and finance)</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The security office''s responsibilities should be easily extracted from the security charter. The authority, rights and obligations of LOB management and the IT organization should have been negotiated via the governance structure prior to, or as part of, the creation of this strategic plan. These authorities, rights and obligations are typically governed via some kind of information security steering committee. Other business areas may be surprised by their inclusion or may have expressed a need for involvement on their own, typically as a response to regulatory compliance needs.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One approach to documenting these roles and responsibilities that has been widely accepted by organization is the use of a responsible, accountable, consulted and informed (RACI) matrix. Once all these steps have been outlined, the executive summary can be written.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Security Strategy', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '398-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-08-29 00:37:29', '2013-08-29 00:37:29', '', 398, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?p=446', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Although there is no industry standard for the contents of such a plan, Securitysense has recommended organizations by using a model that has proved to be an effective communication tool with the numerous interested parties (including senior management), as well as a reasonable tracking mechanism for multiyear progress reports. While the model can be applied by organizations of any size and in any industry, the details vary based on the scale of the organization and the starting maturity level of the various effected organizational units.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The information security strategic plan should not be viewed as a stand-alone document. It should exist as one part of a set of planning documents that start with a charter and a vision statement, but that also extends beyond the strategic plan into tactical and communications plans. Each of these has a role in providing context and action ability for the strategic plan. Organizations that have an established enterprise architecture (EA) function should leverage the existing EA disciplines, processes and standards to ensure that the strategic plan for information security is aligned with the EA strategy (see "Architecting Security: Different Approaches").

Part of the three-year strategic plan should be guidance to tactical planners on how to prioritize the closure of those gaps, such that any natural order is optimized. Controls determine what should be achieved, but controls become meaningful only if the governance structure is functional. The IT organization needs direction via technical architecture to be efficient, but architecture requires guidance from controls. Operational processes related to technologies that are already in place depend, to some degree, on controls (what processes and technologies are needed) and architecture (which process elements and technologies are automated). As a result, a normal prioritization plan might be to start with governance, move to controls, then architecture and finally process. But this is a "greenfield" approach, and it may not be appropriate for organizations with variable levels of maturity in the current information security program or IT organizations in general. For example, a lack of maturity in strategic processes, such as risk assessment and security communications, which are not technology-dependent may demand earlier prioritization.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore, the method by which priorities will be assigned in the tactical plans requires some</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">strategic guidance. More-granular prioritization of work should be included in tactical (annual) planning documents, and should be based on criteria such as the relative risk impact, the cost, the mean time to value and the availability of resources.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This section describes who is responsible for delivering and who is responsible for approving each strategic and tactical deliverable that results from this strategic plan. There are four sets of organizational areas that need to be mapped to deliverables and action plans:</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The security office</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Lines of business (LOBs) or federation issues (responsibilities that reside with persons or departments </span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">that are affiliated with, but not reporting to, the central information security function)</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The IT organization</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Other business areas (typically, the functions that go on in headquarters, such as legal, HR and finance)</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The security office''s responsibilities should be easily extracted from the security charter. The authority, rights and obligations of LOB management and the IT organization should have been negotiated via the governance structure prior to, or as part of, the creation of this strategic plan. These authorities, rights and obligations are typically governed via some kind of information security steering committee. Other business areas may be surprised by their inclusion or may have expressed a need for involvement on their own, typically as a response to regulatory compliance needs.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One approach to documenting these roles and responsibilities that has been widely accepted by organization is the use of a responsible, accountable, consulted and informed (RACI) matrix.

Although there is no industry standard for the contents of such a plan, Securitysense has recommended organizations by using a model that has proved to be an effective communication tool with the numerous interested parties (including senior management), as well as a reasonable tracking mechanism for multiyear progress reports. While the model can be applied by organizations of any size and in any industry, the details vary based on the scale of the organization and the starting maturity level of the various effected organizational units.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The information security strategic plan should not be viewed as a stand-alone document. It should exist as one part of a set of planning documents that start with a charter and a vision statement, but that also extends beyond the strategic plan into tactical and communications plans. Each of these has a role in providing context and action ability for the strategic plan. Organizations that have an established enterprise architecture (EA) function should leverage the existing EA disciplines, processes and standards to ensure that the strategic plan for information security is aligned with the EA strategy (see "Architecting Security: Different Approaches"). Securitysense generally considers three years to be an appropriate window for strategic planning for information security. The charter and vision statements deal with longer-term directions, while the tactical and communications plans specify single-year operational considerations and projects.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The basic layout of the strategic plan is:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Introduction and executive summary</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Strategic plan framework description</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Current state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Desired state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Gap analysis</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Prioritization plan</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Roles and responsibilities</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Introduction and Executive Summary</b></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The introduction should be written first, setting the purpose and scope of the document.

An appropriate framework is one that can show overview (summarized) and detail (planning) information. The summary information should be expressed graphically. Frameworks should encompass controls, architecture and process elements to be complete.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">For organizations with an established EA practice, an enterprise information security architecture (EISA) framework (see "The Structure and Content of an Information Security Architecture Framework") that aligns with the EA framework can act as an effective overall strategic security planning framework. Frameworks for this purpose can be derived from industry standards, from Securitysense research or from a combination of the two. </span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some sources for framework structure and contents are:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Controls</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electro technical</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Commission (IEC) 27002</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-53</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Architecture</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO10181</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO13335</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Processes</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO/IEC 27001</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In addition, Securitysense research can provide significant examples and guidelines for constructing such a framework (see the Recommended Reading section below). Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Although there is no industry standard for the contents of such a plan, Securitysense has recommended organizations by using a model that has proved to be an effective communication tool with the numerous interested parties (including senior management), as well as a reasonable tracking mechanism for multiyear progress reports. While the model can be applied by organizations of any size and in any industry, the details vary based on the scale of the organization and the starting maturity level of the various effected organizational units.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The information security strategic plan should not be viewed as a stand-alone document. It should exist as one part of a set of planning documents that start with a charter and a vision statement, but that also extends beyond the strategic plan into tactical and communications plans. Each of these has a role in providing context and action ability for the strategic plan. Organizations that have an established enterprise architecture (EA) function should leverage the existing EA disciplines, processes and standards to ensure that the strategic plan for information security is aligned with the EA strategy (see "Architecting Security: Different Approaches"). Securitysense generally considers three years to be an appropriate window for strategic planning for information security. The charter and vision statements deal with longer-term directions, while the tactical and communications plans specify single-year operational considerations and projects.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The basic layout of the strategic plan is:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Introduction and executive summary</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Strategic plan framework description</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Current state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Desired state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Gap analysis</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Prioritization plan</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Roles and responsibilities</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Introduction and Executive Summary</b></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The introduction should be written first, setting the purpose and scope of the document. The executive summary should be written last, showing only the final points of the document. The combination of executive summary and introduction should not exceed three pages, and, for most organizations, should be no more than two pages.</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Strategic Plan Framework Description</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The framework is the method by which the current state, desired state and gap analysis will be documented. An appropriate framework is one that can show overview (summarized) and detail (planning) information. The summary information should be expressed graphically. Frameworks should encompass controls, architecture and process elements to be complete.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">For organizations with an established EA practice, an enterprise information security architecture (EISA) framework (see "The Structure and Content of an Information Security Architecture Framework") that aligns with the EA framework can act as an effective overall strategic security planning framework. Frameworks for this purpose can be derived from industry standards, from Securitysense research or from a combination of the two. </span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some sources for framework structure and contents are:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Controls</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electro technical</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Commission (IEC) 27002</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-53</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Architecture</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO10181</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO13335</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Processes</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO/IEC 27001</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In addition, Securitysense research can provide significant examples and guidelines for constructing such a framework (see the Recommended Reading section below). Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Brief text descriptions contain the background for each target value. Securitysense recommends that a change in maturity level of no more than a "2" be attempted for any framework element in a three-year period, unless exceptional resources and executive support can be assured (see Figure 3 for an example based on Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 3.

Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Brief text descriptions contain the background for each target value. Securitysense recommends that a change in maturity level of no more than a "2" be attempted for any framework element in a three-year period, unless exceptional resources and executive support can be assured (see Figure 3 for an example based on Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 3.

Part of the three-year strategic plan should be guidance to tactical planners on how to prioritize the closure of those gaps, such that any natural order is optimized. Controls determine what should be achieved, but controls become meaningful only if the governance structure is functional. The IT organization needs direction via technical architecture to be efficient, but architecture requires guidance from controls. Operational processes related to technologies that are already in place depend, to some degree, on controls (what processes and technologies are needed) and architecture (which process elements and technologies are automated). As a result, a normal prioritization plan might be to start with governance, move to controls, then architecture and finally process. But this is a "greenfield" approach, and it may not be appropriate for organizations with variable levels of maturity in the current information security program or IT organizations in general. For example, a lack of maturity in strategic processes, such as risk assessment and security communications, which are not technology-dependent may demand earlier prioritization.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore, the method by which priorities will be assigned in the tactical plans requires some</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">strategic guidance. More-granular prioritization of work should be included in tactical (annual) planning documents, and should be based on criteria such as the relative risk impact, the cost, the mean time to value and the availability of resources.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This section describes who is responsible for delivering and who is responsible for approving each strategic and tactical deliverable that results from this strategic plan.

Part of the three-year strategic plan should be guidance to tactical planners on how to prioritize the closure of those gaps, such that any natural order is optimized. Controls determine what should be achieved, but controls become meaningful only if the governance structure is functional. The IT organization needs direction via technical architecture to be efficient, but architecture requires guidance from controls. Operational processes related to technologies that are already in place depend, to some degree, on controls (what processes and technologies are needed) and architecture (which process elements and technologies are automated). As a result, a normal prioritization plan might be to start with governance, move to controls, then architecture and finally process. But this is a "greenfield" approach, and it may not be appropriate for organizations with variable levels of maturity in the current information security program or IT organizations in general. For example, a lack of maturity in strategic processes, such as risk assessment and security communications, which are not technology-dependent may demand earlier prioritization.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore, the method by which priorities will be assigned in the tactical plans requires some</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">strategic guidance. More-granular prioritization of work should be included in tactical (annual) planning documents, and should be based on criteria such as the relative risk impact, the cost, the mean time to value and the availability of resources.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This section describes who is responsible for delivering and who is responsible for approving each strategic and tactical deliverable that results from this strategic plan. There are four sets of organizational areas that need to be mapped to deliverables and action plans:</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The security office</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Lines of business (LOBs) or federation issues (responsibilities that reside with persons or departments </span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">that are affiliated with, but not reporting to, the central information security function)</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The IT organization</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Other business areas (typically, the functions that go on in headquarters, such as legal, HR and finance)</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The security office''s responsibilities should be easily extracted from the security charter. The authority, rights and obligations of LOB management and the IT organization should have been negotiated via the governance structure prior to, or as part of, the creation of this strategic plan. These authorities, rights and obligations are typically governed via some kind of information security steering committee. Other business areas may be surprised by their inclusion or may have expressed a need for involvement on their own, typically as a response to regulatory compliance needs.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One approach to documenting these roles and responsibilities that has been widely accepted by organization is the use of a responsible, accountable, consulted and informed (RACI) matrix.

Although there is no industry standard for the contents of such a plan, Securitysense has recommended organizations by using a model that has proved to be an effective communication tool with the numerous interested parties (including senior management), as well as a reasonable tracking mechanism for multiyear progress reports. While the model can be applied by organizations of any size and in any industry, the details vary based on the scale of the organization and the starting maturity level of the various effected organizational units.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The information security strategic plan should not be viewed as a stand-alone document. It should exist as one part of a set of planning documents that start with a charter and a vision statement, but that also extends beyond the strategic plan into tactical and communications plans. Each of these has a role in providing context and action ability for the strategic plan. Organizations that have an established enterprise architecture (EA) function should leverage the existing EA disciplines, processes and standards to ensure that the strategic plan for information security is aligned with the EA strategy (see "Architecting Security: Different Approaches").

Part of the three-year strategic plan should be guidance to tactical planners on how to prioritize the closure of those gaps, such that any natural order is optimized. Controls determine what should be achieved, but controls become meaningful only if the governance structure is functional. The IT organization needs direction via technical architecture to be efficient, but architecture requires guidance from controls. Operational processes related to technologies that are already in place depend, to some degree, on controls (what processes and technologies are needed) and architecture (which process elements and technologies are automated). As a result, a normal prioritization plan might be to start with governance, move to controls, then architecture and finally process. But this is a "greenfield" approach, and it may not be appropriate for organizations with variable levels of maturity in the current information security program or IT organizations in general. For example, a lack of maturity in strategic processes, such as risk assessment and security communications, which are not technology-dependent may demand earlier prioritization.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore, the method by which priorities will be assigned in the tactical plans requires some</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">strategic guidance. More-granular prioritization of work should be included in tactical (annual) planning documents, and should be based on criteria such as the relative risk impact, the cost, the mean time to value and the availability of resources.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This section describes who is responsible for delivering and who is responsible for approving each strategic and tactical deliverable that results from this strategic plan. There are four sets of organizational areas that need to be mapped to deliverables and action plans:</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The security office</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Lines of business (LOBs) or federation issues (responsibilities that reside with persons or departments </span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">that are affiliated with, but not reporting to, the central information security function)</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The IT organization</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY">â¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Other business areas (typically, the functions that go on in headquarters, such as legal, HR and finance)</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The security office''s responsibilities should be easily extracted from the security charter. The authority, rights and obligations of LOB management and the IT organization should have been negotiated via the governance structure prior to, or as part of, the creation of this strategic plan. These authorities, rights and obligations are typically governed via some kind of information security steering committee. Other business areas may be surprised by their inclusion or may have expressed a need for involvement on their own, typically as a response to regulatory compliance needs.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One approach to documenting these roles and responsibilities that has been widely accepted by organization is the use of a responsible, accountable, consulted and informed (RACI) matrix. Once all these steps have been outlined, the executive summary can be written.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Security Strategy', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '398-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-08-29 00:40:17', '2013-08-29 00:40:17', '', 398, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?p=451', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Although there is no industry standard for the contents of such a plan, Securitysense has recommended organizations by using a model that has proved to be an effective communication tool with the numerous interested parties (including senior management), as well as a reasonable tracking mechanism for multiyear progress reports. While the model can be applied by organizations of any size and in any industry, the details vary based on the scale of the organization and the starting maturity level of the various effected organizational units.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The information security strategic plan should not be viewed as a stand-alone document. It should exist as one part of a set of planning documents that start with a charter and a vision statement, but that also extends beyond the strategic plan into tactical and communications plans. Each of these has a role in providing context and action ability for the strategic plan. Organizations that have an established enterprise architecture (EA) function should leverage the existing EA disciplines, processes and standards to ensure that the strategic plan for information security is aligned with the EA strategy (see "Architecting Security: Different Approaches"). Securitysense generally considers three years to be an appropriate window for strategic planning for information security. The charter and vision statements deal with longer-term directions, while the tactical and communications plans specify single-year operational considerations and projects.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The basic layout of the strategic plan is:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Introduction and executive summary</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Strategic plan framework description</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Current state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Desired state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Gap analysis</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Prioritization plan</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Roles and responsibilities</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Introduction and Executive Summary</b></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The introduction should be written first, setting the purpose and scope of the document. The executive summary should be written last, showing only the final points of the document. The combination of executive summary and introduction should not exceed three pages, and, for most organizations, should be no more than two pages.</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Strategic Plan Framework Description</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The framework is the method by which the current state, desired state and gap analysis will be documented. An appropriate framework is one that can show overview (summarized) and detail (planning) information. The summary information should be expressed graphically. Frameworks should encompass controls, architecture and process elements to be complete.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">For organizations with an established EA practice, an enterprise information security architecture (EISA) framework (see "The Structure and Content of an Information Security Architecture Framework") that aligns with the EA framework can act as an effective overall strategic security planning framework. Frameworks for this purpose can be derived from industry standards, from Securitysense research or from a combination of the two. </span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some sources for framework structure and contents are:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Controls</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electro technical</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Commission (IEC) 27002</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-53</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Architecture</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO10181</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO13335</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Processes</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO/IEC 27001</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In addition, Securitysense research can provide significant examples and guidelines for constructing such a framework (see the Recommended Reading section below). Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Although there is no industry standard for the contents of such a plan, Securitysense has recommended organizations by using a model that has proved to be an effective communication tool with the numerous interested parties (including senior management), as well as a reasonable tracking mechanism for multiyear progress reports. While the model can be applied by organizations of any size and in any industry, the details vary based on the scale of the organization and the starting maturity level of the various effected organizational units.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The information security strategic plan should not be viewed as a stand-alone document. It should exist as one part of a set of planning documents that start with a charter and a vision statement, but that also extends beyond the strategic plan into tactical and communications plans. Each of these has a role in providing context and action ability for the strategic plan. Organizations that have an established enterprise architecture (EA) function should leverage the existing EA disciplines, processes and standards to ensure that the strategic plan for information security is aligned with the EA strategy (see "Architecting Security: Different Approaches"). Securitysense generally considers three years to be an appropriate window for strategic planning for information security. The charter and vision statements deal with longer-term directions, while the tactical and communications plans specify single-year operational considerations and projects.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The basic layout of the strategic plan is:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Introduction and executive summary</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Strategic plan framework description</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Current state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Desired state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Gap analysis</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Prioritization plan</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Roles and responsibilities</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Introduction and Executive Summary</b></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The introduction should be written first, setting the purpose and scope of the document.

The combination of executive summary and introduction should not exceed three pages, and, for most organizations, should be no more than two pages.</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Strategic Plan Framework Description</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The framework is the method by which the current state, desired state and gap analysis will be documented. An appropriate framework is one that can show overview (summarized) and detail (planning) information. The summary information should be expressed graphically. Frameworks should encompass controls, architecture and process elements to be complete.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">For organizations with an established EA practice, an enterprise information security architecture (EISA) framework (see "The Structure and Content of an Information Security Architecture Framework") that aligns with the EA framework can act as an effective overall strategic security planning framework. Frameworks for this purpose can be derived from industry standards, from Securitysense research or from a combination of the two. </span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some sources for framework structure and contents are:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Controls</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electro technical</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Commission (IEC) 27002</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-53</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Architecture</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO10181</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO13335</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Processes</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO/IEC 27001</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In addition, Securitysense research can provide significant examples and guidelines for constructing such a framework (see the Recommended Reading section below). Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Brief text descriptions contain the background for each target value.

Although there is no industry standard for the contents of such a plan, Securitysense has recommended organizations by using a model that has proved to be an effective communication tool with the numerous interested parties (including senior management), as well as a reasonable tracking mechanism for multiyear progress reports.

It should exist as one part of a set of planning documents that start with a charter and a vision statement, but that also extends beyond the strategic plan into tactical and communications plans. Each of these has a role in providing context and action ability for the strategic plan. Organizations that have an established enterprise architecture (EA) function should leverage the existing EA disciplines, processes and standards to ensure that the strategic plan for information security is aligned with the EA strategy (see "Architecting Security: Different Approaches"). Securitysense generally considers three years to be an appropriate window for strategic planning for information security.

An appropriate framework is one that can show overview (summarized) and detail (planning) information. The summary information should be expressed graphically. Frameworks should encompass controls, architecture and process elements to be complete.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">For organizations with an established EA practice, an enterprise information security architecture (EISA) framework (see "The Structure and Content of an Information Security Architecture Framework") that aligns with the EA framework can act as an effective overall strategic security planning framework. Frameworks for this purpose can be derived from industry standards, from Securitysense research or from a combination of the two. </span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some sources for framework structure and contents are:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Controls</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electro technical</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Commission (IEC) 27002</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-53</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Architecture</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO10181</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO13335</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Processes</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO/IEC 27001</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</span></span>\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In addition, Securitysense research can provide significant examples and guidelines for constructing such a framework (see the Recommended Reading section below). Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Three years is not a long time to achieve any sort of cultural change, nor for a significant reduction in the overall level of risk.

Brief text descriptions contain the background for each target value. Securitysense recommends that a change in maturity level of no more than a "2" be attempted for any framework element in a three-year period, unless exceptional resources and executive support can be assured (see Figure 3 for an example based on Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 3.

Part of the three-year strategic plan should be guidance to tactical planners on how to prioritize the closure of those gaps, such that any natural order is optimized. Controls determine what should be achieved, but controls become meaningful only if the governance structure is functional. The IT organization needs direction via technical architecture to be efficient, but architecture requires guidance from controls. Operational processes related to technologies that are already in place depend, to some degree, on controls (what processes and technologies are needed) and architecture (which process elements and technologies are automated). As a result, a normal prioritization plan might be to start with governance, move to controls, then architecture and finally process. But this is a "greenfield" approach, and it may not be appropriate for organizations with variable levels of maturity in the current information security program or IT organizations in general. For example, a lack of maturity in strategic processes, such as risk assessment and security communications, which are not technology-dependent may demand earlier prioritization.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore, the method by which priorities will be assigned in the tactical plans requires some</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">strategic guidance. More-granular prioritization of work should be included in tactical (annual) planning documents, and should be based on criteria such as the relative risk impact, the cost, the mean time to value and the availability of resources.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This section describes who is responsible for delivering and who is responsible for approving each strategic and tactical deliverable that results from this strategic plan.

The charter and vision statements deal with longer-term directions, while the tactical and communications plans specify single-year operational considerations and projects.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The basic layout of the strategic plan is:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Introduction and executive summary</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Strategic plan framework description</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Current state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Desired state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Gap analysis</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Prioritization plan</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Roles and responsibilities</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Introduction and Executive Summary</b></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The introduction should be written first, setting the purpose and scope of the document. The executive summary should be written last, showing only the final points of the document. The combination of executive summary and introduction should not exceed three pages, and, for most organizations, should be no more than two pages.</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Strategic Plan Framework Description</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The framework is the method by which the current state, desired state and gap analysis will be documented. An appropriate framework is one that can show overview (summarized) and detail (planning) information. The summary information should be expressed graphically. Frameworks should encompass controls, architecture and process elements to be complete.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">For organizations with an established EA practice, an enterprise information security architecture (EISA) framework (see "The Structure and Content of an Information Security Architecture Framework") that aligns with the EA framework can act as an effective overall strategic security planning framework. Frameworks for this purpose can be derived from industry standards, from Securitysense research or from a combination of the two. </span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some sources for framework structure and contents are:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Controls</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electro technical</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Commission (IEC) 27002</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-53</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Architecture</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO10181</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO13335</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Processes</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO/IEC 27001</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In addition, Securitysense research can provide significant examples and guidelines for constructing such a framework (see the Recommended Reading section below). Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Brief text descriptions contain the background for each target value. Securitysense recommends that a change in maturity level of no more than a "2" be attempted for any framework element in a three-year period, unless exceptional resources and executive support can be assured (see Figure 3 for an example based on Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 3.

Part of the three-year strategic plan should be guidance to tactical planners on how to prioritize the closure of those gaps, such that any natural order is optimized. Controls determine what should be achieved, but controls become meaningful only if the governance structure is functional. The IT organization needs direction via technical architecture to be efficient, but architecture requires guidance from controls. Operational processes related to technologies that are already in place depend, to some degree, on controls (what processes and technologies are needed) and architecture (which process elements and technologies are automated). As a result, a normal prioritization plan might be to start with governance, move to controls, then architecture and finally process. But this is a "greenfield" approach, and it may not be appropriate for organizations with variable levels of maturity in the current information security program or IT organizations in general. For example, a lack of maturity in strategic processes, such as risk assessment and security communications, which are not technology-dependent may demand earlier prioritization.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore, the method by which priorities will be assigned in the tactical plans requires some</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">strategic guidance. More-granular prioritization of work should be included in tactical (annual) planning documents, and should be based on criteria such as the relative risk impact, the cost, the mean time to value and the availability of resources.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This section describes who is responsible for delivering and who is responsible for approving each strategic and tactical deliverable that results from this strategic plan.

The authority, rights and obligations of LOB management and the IT organization should have been negotiated via the governance structure prior to, or as part of, the creation of this strategic plan. These authorities, rights and obligations are typically governed via some kind of information security steering committee. Other business areas may be surprised by their inclusion or may have expressed a need for involvement on their own, typically as a response to regulatory compliance needs.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One approach to documenting these roles and responsibilities that has been widely accepted by organization is the use of a responsible, accountable, consulted and informed (RACI) matrix.

From a legal and compliance perspective, an information security policy is often viewed as a commitment from senior management to protect information. A documented policy is frequently a requirement to satisfy regulations or laws, such as those relating to privacy and finance. It should be viewed as a business mandate and must be driven from the top (i.e. senior management) downwards in order to be effective.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Policies are the business rules and guidelines of a company that ensure consistency and compliance with the companyâs strategic direction.Â  The Policies lay out the business rules under which a company, division, or department will operate.</b></span></span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Policies are the guidelines under which Procedures are developed.Â  There is not a one-to-one relationship between a Policy and a Procedure.Â  Policies are not part of the Procedure, because they cannot be properly structured.Â  However, the Procedure must reflect the business rules contained in the Policies.Â </b></span></span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Policies address <em>what</em> the Policy is and its classification,<em> who</em> is responsible for the execution and enforcement of the Policy, and <em>why</em> the Policy is required.Â Â </b></span></span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: large;">Process </span></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Processes are related activities that produce a specific service or product (example, Procurement to Payment).Â  The majority of Processes cross departments or functional areas.Â  Each Process designates the connect points and where it crosses department lines.Â  The documentation presents the total Process.Â  It is helpful to be able to reference or drill down to the applicable Policy or Procedure for a Process step.Â  A Process map is a useful tool to graphically display the Process.Â </span></span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Processes indicate where there is a separation of responsibilities and control points.Â  They are also very helpful to identify Policy and Procedure requirements.Â  Processes address </span></span><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>who</b></span></span></em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> is responsible to perform the Process (department, division), </span></span><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>what</b></span></span></em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> major functions are performed, and </span></span><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>when</b></span></span></em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> the function is triggered.Â Â </span></span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size: large;">Procedure </span></h2>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Procedures consist of </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>step by step instructions</b></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> to assist workers in implementing the various policies, standards and guidelines.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #00577d;">Â </span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Whilst the policies, standards and guidelines consist of the controls that should be in place, a procedure gets down to specifics, explaining how to implement these controls in a step by step fashion.

Although there is no industry standard for the contents of such a plan, Securitysense has recommended organizations by using a model that has proved to be an effective communication tool with the numerous interested parties (including senior management), as well as a reasonable tracking mechanism for multiyear progress reports. While the model can be applied by organizations of any size and in any industry, the details vary based on the scale of the organization and the starting maturity level of the various effected organizational units.</span></span></p>\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The information security strategic plan should not be viewed as a stand-alone document. It should exist as one part of a set of planning documents that start with a charter and a vision statement, but that also extends beyond the strategic plan into tactical and communications plans. Each of these has a role in providing context and action ability for the strategic plan. Organizations that have an established enterprise architecture (EA) function should leverage the existing EA disciplines, processes and standards to ensure that the strategic plan for information security is aligned with the EA strategy (see "Architecting Security: Different Approaches"). Securitysense generally considers three years to be an appropriate window for strategic planning for information security. The charter and vision statements deal with longer-term directions, while the tactical and communications plans specify single-year operational considerations and projects.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The basic layout of the strategic plan is:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Introduction and executive summary</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Strategic plan framework description</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Current state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Desired state</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Gap analysis</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Prioritization plan</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Roles and responsibilities</span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Introduction and Executive Summary</b></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The introduction should be written first, setting the purpose and scope of the document.

An appropriate framework is one that can show overview (summarized) and detail (planning) information. The summary information should be expressed graphically. Frameworks should encompass controls, architecture and process elements to be complete.</span></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">For organizations with an established EA practice, an enterprise information security architecture (EISA) framework (see "The Structure and Content of an Information Security Architecture Framework") that aligns with the EA framework can act as an effective overall strategic security planning framework. Frameworks for this purpose can be derived from industry standards, from Securitysense research or from a combination of the two. </span></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some sources for framework structure and contents are:</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Controls</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electro technical</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Commission (IEC) 27002</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-53</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Architecture</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO10181</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO13335</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Processes</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">ISO/IEC 27001</span></span>\r\n\r\nâ¢ <span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</span></span>\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In addition, Securitysense research can provide significant examples and guidelines for constructing such a framework (see the Recommended Reading section below). Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Three years is not a long time to achieve any sort of cultural change, nor for a significant reduction in the overall level of risk.

Brief text descriptions contain the background for each target value. Securitysense recommends that a change in maturity level of no more than a "2" be attempted for any framework element in a three-year period, unless exceptional resources and executive support can be assured (see Figure 3 for an example based on Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 3.

Part of the three-year strategic plan should be guidance to tactical planners on how to prioritize the closure of those gaps, such that any natural order is optimized. Controls determine what should be achieved, but controls become meaningful only if the governance structure is functional. The IT organization needs direction via technical architecture to be efficient, but architecture requires guidance from controls. Operational processes related to technologies that are already in place depend, to some degree, on controls (what processes and technologies are needed) and architecture (which process elements and technologies are automated). As a result, a normal prioritization plan might be to start with governance, move to controls, then architecture and finally process. But this is a "greenfield" approach, and it may not be appropriate for organizations with variable levels of maturity in the current information security program or IT organizations in general. For example, a lack of maturity in strategic processes, such as risk assessment and security communications, which are not technology-dependent may demand earlier prioritization.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore, the method by which priorities will be assigned in the tactical plans requires some</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">strategic guidance. More-granular prioritization of work should be included in tactical (annual) planning documents, and should be based on criteria such as the relative risk impact, the cost, the mean time to value and the availability of resources.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This section describes who is responsible for delivering and who is responsible for approving each strategic and tactical deliverable that results from this strategic plan.

The authority, rights and obligations of LOB management and the IT organization should have been negotiated via the governance structure prior to, or as part of, the creation of this strategic plan. These authorities, rights and obligations are typically governed via some kind of information security steering committee. Other business areas may be surprised by their inclusion or may have expressed a need for involvement on their own, typically as a response to regulatory compliance needs.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One approach to documenting these roles and responsibilities that has been widely accepted by organization is the use of a responsible, accountable, consulted and informed (RACI) matrix.

Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Brief text descriptions contain the background for each target value. Securitysense recommends that a change in maturity level of no more than a "2" be attempted for any framework element in a three-year period, unless exceptional resources and executive support can be assured (see Figure 3 for an example based on Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 3.

Part of the three-year strategic plan should be guidance to tactical planners on how to prioritize the closure of those gaps, such that any natural order is optimized. Controls determine what should be achieved, but controls become meaningful only if the governance structure is functional. The IT organization needs direction via technical architecture to be efficient, but architecture requires guidance from controls. Operational processes related to technologies that are already in place depend, to some degree, on controls (what processes and technologies are needed) and architecture (which process elements and technologies are automated). As a result, a normal prioritization plan might be to start with governance, move to controls, then architecture and finally process. But this is a "greenfield" approach, and it may not be appropriate for organizations with variable levels of maturity in the current information security program or IT organizations in general. For example, a lack of maturity in strategic processes, such as risk assessment and security communications, which are not technology-dependent may demand earlier prioritization.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore, the method by which priorities will be assigned in the tactical plans requires some</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">strategic guidance. More-granular prioritization of work should be included in tactical (annual) planning documents, and should be based on criteria such as the relative risk impact, the cost, the mean time to value and the availability of resources.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This section describes who is responsible for delivering and who is responsible for approving each strategic and tactical deliverable that results from this strategic plan.

The authority, rights and obligations of LOB management and the IT organization should have been negotiated via the governance structure prior to, or as part of, the creation of this strategic plan. These authorities, rights and obligations are typically governed via some kind of information security steering committee. Other business areas may be surprised by their inclusion or may have expressed a need for involvement on their own, typically as a response to regulatory compliance needs.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One approach to documenting these roles and responsibilities that has been widely accepted by organization is the use of a responsible, accountable, consulted and informed (RACI) matrix.

Large, mature organizations will require more-complex, detailed frameworks that focus largely on processes. Smaller or less mature organizations will find that simple frameworks suffice, and that all details can be left to the tactical planning stage, but that balanced (perhaps, not equal) attention to the three areas of controls, architecture and processes is required. An example of a simple framework for a low maturity organization might be a three-by-four grid showing the state of controls, technical architecture and processes for data, infrastructure, applications and people/behavior. Each cell in the grid can be assessed or targeted (depending on whether it is the current state or desired state framework copy) on a typical numeric maturity scale of 0 through 5, or assigned a color code of red, yellow or green (see Figure 1).</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Larger or more-mature organizations will tend to focus more on process assessments, because controls and architecture tend to be well-defined, and the processes by which they are kept up to date will be defined and will be the primary lever for further maturation. </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Securitysense''s "Toolkit: Risk Program Maturity Assessment 1.0" provides a full process-oriented framework that includes graphical reporting of information security, privacy, regulatory compliance and business continuity</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">programs (see Figure 2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Figure 2.

Brief text descriptions contain the background for each target value.

Part of the three-year strategic plan should be guidance to tactical planners on how to prioritize the closure of those gaps, such that any natural order is optimized. Controls determine what should be achieved, but controls become meaningful only if the governance structure is functional. The IT organization needs direction via technical architecture to be efficient, but architecture requires guidance from controls. Operational processes related to technologies that are already in place depend, to some degree, on controls (what processes and technologies are needed) and architecture (which process elements and technologies are automated). As a result, a normal prioritization plan might be to start with governance, move to controls, then architecture and finally process. But this is a "greenfield" approach, and it may not be appropriate for organizations with variable levels of maturity in the current information security program or IT organizations in general. For example, a lack of maturity in strategic processes, such as risk assessment and security communications, which are not technology-dependent may demand earlier prioritization.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore, the method by which priorities will be assigned in the tactical plans requires some</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">strategic guidance. More-granular prioritization of work should be included in tactical (annual) planning documents, and should be based on criteria such as the relative risk impact, the cost, the mean time to value and the availability of resources.</span></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial-BoldMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roles and Responsibilities</b></span></span>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This section describes who is responsible for delivering and who is responsible for approving each strategic and tactical deliverable that results from this strategic plan.

The authority, rights and obligations of LOB management and the IT organization should have been negotiated via the governance structure prior to, or as part of, the creation of this strategic plan. These authorities, rights and obligations are typically governed via some kind of information security steering committee. Other business areas may be surprised by their inclusion or may have expressed a need for involvement on their own, typically as a response to regulatory compliance needs.</span></span></p>\r\n<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family: ArialMT,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One approach to documenting these roles and responsibilities that has been widely accepted by organization is the use of a responsible, accountable, consulted and informed (RACI) matrix.
